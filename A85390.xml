            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE daies of mine abiding with you in the fleſh, neither you, nor my ſelf can expect ſhould be many. The Law of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity eſtabliſhed in Heaven, and daily put in vigorous execution on Earth, cutteth off this hope and expectance, both from you and me. But the comfort is, the hole of this pit is not onely levelled and fill'd up, but a mount alſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon it, by <hi>the Law of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> If our forlorn of miniſteriall accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations be ſcattered and defeated, by the hand of death, or otherwiſe, our reſerve in Heaven will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and bring us off from the world with honour and peace howſoever. The great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb facs="tcp:111412:3"/> of life and ſalvation unto thoſe who beleeve, for the making good whereof Jeſus Chriſt himſelf with all his glory, are given in pawn and pledge unto the world, are not ſuſpended upon the preſence of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, one or other, but glory in the truth, faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and power, of him who hath made them, and are ready to ſwallow up into victory, whatſoever ſhall threaten, or oppoſe their performance.</p>
            <p>Not withſtanding, as the great Apoſtle, though (as he ſaith) he know how to be hungry, as well as to be full, and to ſuffer want as well as to abound, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to his <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>they had done well in communicating with his affliction</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4. 12, 14.</note>. In like manner however the great and glorious God, knows as well how to want, as to abound, in reſpect of miniſteriall diſpenſations, and is able without his <hi>earthen veſsels,</hi> to convey his <hi>veſſels of honour,</hi> into their bleſſedneſſe and glory, yet there is little queſtion to be made, but that he graciouſly, accepteth the diligent and faithfull ſervice even of theſe his <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> in making one ſhoulder with him to advance and carry on this great and bleſſed deſign. And for you though I am upon grounds of ſoberneſſe and truth abundantly confident (at leaſt of many of you) that your anointing is ſuch, that you ſtand in as little need of any mans teaching <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note>, as any other people, yet I know alſo, that no people whatſoever will more thankfully relliſh and accept of the labour and travell of any mans ſoul, either for their edification, or eſtabliſhment, then you.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe two conſiderations in conjunction with the great and longing deſire of my ſoul, that your whole ſpirit and ſoul, and body, <hi>may be preſerved blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse,
<pb facs="tcp:111412:3"/> unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 23.</note>. I ſhall endeavour, whilſt I yet remain with you, to prevent as much as may be, any ſuppoſed or feared inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in my departure from you. And this (I judge) I ſhall attempt upon the beſt terms of likelyhood of ſucceſſe, by ſeeking to leave as much of my ſpirit with you, as I know how, when my bodily preſence ſhall be diſpoſed of otherwiſe. In order hereunto, not knowing how near the laying aſide of this earthly tabernacle may be at hand, I have thought it meet not only to leave the enſuing treatiſe, for your peruſall after that generall manner, wherein it is left for other men, but to incorporate with it, the expreſſe mention, and that dear remembrance of you, which I have in my ſoul; that ſo in one and the ſame monument, the whole and intire ſpirit of your Paſtor, as well for morals, as intellectuals, may be preſerved for your converſe, and to make company for your mindes and ſpirits, when you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>You are my preſent joy; and will be (I hope) my future crown: for neither hath your faith hitherto, through any bewitchings of the fleſh, preſumed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into Heaven, to bring downſome other <hi>Jeſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, nor have you ſuffered <hi>your mindes to be corrupted from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel:</hi> nor your ſelves to be baptized into any other ſpirit, then that which ſpeaketh <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> expreſly in the Scriptures. You have neither preſumed to be wiſe above, nor yet been ſatiſfied to be ignorant beneath, what is written. Whilſt many profeſſours have compaſſed themſelves with ſparks of their own kindling, you have warmed your hearts with faith and love at that fire, which Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:111412:4"/> Chriſt himſelf came from Heaven to kindle on the earth <note n="a" place="margin">Luk 12. 49.</note>, and ſo have kept your ſelves out of the dint of the ſore judgement of God, which the Scripture calls <hi>a delivering up unto an injudicious minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I recommend you to God, and to that word of his grace which he ſpeaketh in the Scriptures, both unto you, and to the world, and which is able (ſo you pervert it not with myſticall and forged interpretations, thus making it to become your own, in ſtead of his) <hi>to build you up and to give you an inheritance among them which are ſanctified,</hi> and implore with all humble and unfained ardency of ſoul, that <hi>great Shepheard of the Sheep,</hi> ſo to proſper you in the hand of that poor under-Shepheard whom he hath ſet over you, that you may be found of him at the great day.</p>

And the conſciences of thoſe who diſtaſt the waies of holineſſe and religion, have no other Sanctuary to flee unto for ſecurity and peace, but an exauthorization of the Scriptures, or a deniall of their deſcent from God. A competent, yea or tolerable belief of their divinity, in conjunction with a like proportion of knowledge in them, muſt needs make an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart and life, burthens intolerable. So that men who ſuffer, either the wiſdome of the fleſh, or the pleaſures, or profits of the world, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage their hearts from the love of religion, and waies of holineſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſometimes they walked, put the iron yoke of this ſad neceſſity upon their own necks, even to indulge and favour their conſciences to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they are able, or know how, with a ſuppoſall, that the words of the Scriptures, <hi>are but winde,</hi> and God only the pretended, not the naturall, or reall Authour, and Father of them.

               <hi>attained it already.</hi> In like manner it may be truly ſaid, that many might have attained a ſolid and ſound belief of the Scriptures, and of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, had they not anticipated, the belief it ſelf, with a looſe ſuppoſition, or imagination of it. Now there had been no place in them for ſuch a ſuppoſition or imagination as this, had not ſomething in them like unto ſuch a belief, prepared it. Similitude is a Great Deceiver in the world; and the ſame in colour, frequently intertained, for the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And to a ſolid and ſound belief of the Scriptures, there is no ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, but an ill-grounded and ſuperficiall belief onely. Such a belief as this, though it be good for little, but to afford men an opportunity to dally and play faſt and looſe with God, and to turn hell and Heaven into a paſtime, yet ſtrange is the contentment of men and women, who ſit under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it. A dead faith makes them beleeve they are alive, even whilſt they are <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes:</hi> yea ſometimes it inticeth and draweth men on to ſo much ſin and wickedneſſe, that God in an holy and juſt revenge takes even it alſo out of the hearts of men, and ſo leaves them faithleſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. And let this be carefully remembred; that to be <hi>faithleſſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> after a dead faith, is a condition a thouſand times more hopeleſſe, then before it. God no where ſaith, If a man hath not <hi>drawn near</hi> unto me, <hi>my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him:</hi> many times <hi>his ſoul hath</hi> ſo farre <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in ſuch a man, as to beſtow the unvaluable gift of a ſound Faith and repentance on him. But what ſaith he? we have already heard it: <hi>If the juſt man (any man,</hi> ſay our Tranſlatours) <hi>ſhall draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not yet at the coar of the ulcer: the ſpring-head of the great Sin and miſery proportionable, of our Anti-Scripturiſt, lieth yet lower in the ground. If there be a reaſon or cauſe aſſigneable of his dead Faith, this is like to be the root that beareth it. What the reaſon or cauſe is of a dead faith in any man, will eaſily be conceived, if the nature of this Faith be but taken a little into conſideration, and underſtood. A dead Faith is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo called (I mean, dead) onely becauſe it acteth not, or bringeth forth no fruit, at all: there is no <hi>Faith</hi> at all, <hi>dead</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe: the Faith of <hi>Iudas, Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> of the ſecond, and third ground, <hi>&amp;c</hi> brought forth fruit, and this like unto the fruit of a living Faith (as farre as men were able poſitively to judge of it) yea, probably, in as great plenty, as a living Faith it ſelf is wont to bear. And yet the reſpective Faiths of all theſe,
<pb facs="tcp:111412:6"/> were <hi>dead,</hi> in that ſenſe and ſignification of the word, <hi>Dead,</hi> wherein we now uſe it. Indeed the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> concludeth that <hi>Faith to be dead,</hi> which is <hi>without works</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore by <hi>a dead Faith,</hi> I mean (with the Scripture) ſuch a Faith or credulity, which <hi>Solomon</hi> aſcribes to the <hi>ſimple</hi> or <hi>fooliſh,</hi> Prov. 14. 15 <hi>The ſimple beleeveth every word,</hi> viz that he heareth, or that is ſpoken to him, without any act of dijudication between <hi>word</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> without any rationall and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall inquiry, whether there be any competent and ſufficient ground to judge that <hi>word,</hi> or ſaying, true, which <hi>he beleeveth.</hi> So by a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (doubtleſſe) meaneth ſuch a Faith or conſent unto ſupernaturall Truths, which is haſtily, and without due conſideration rais'd in the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and which is able to give no ſubſtantiall, rationall, or ſolid account of it ſelf, either to it ſelf, or unto others. Of this kinde, is that Faith, which is meerly built either 1. upon the credit, authority, or good opinion of our Teachers: or 2. upon ſome great and plauſible concurrence of the judgements of men ſuppoſed learned and Orthodox: or 3. upon the perſwaſion and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Anceſtors and fore-fathers: or 4. upon the determinations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, of the State, where we live: or 5. upon the generall profeſſion and practiſe of that Nation, or commonalty of perſons, amongſt whom we live: or 6. upon light and undigeſted apprehenſions of grounds, though in themſelves never ſo demonſtrative, weighty and ſubſtantiall: or 7. and laſtly, upon whatſoever is not ſufficient in a rationall way to poyſe or bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe the judgement and conſcience with ſuch an aſſurance of truth, in what is in this caſe beleeved, or aſſented unto, but that they ſhall ſtill remain obnoxious and liable to be removed, and taken off, from their preſent belief, by the guſts and blaſts of contrary apprehenſions, in caſe they come in their way. The reaſon why ſuch a Faith, which is built only upon ſome, or more, or all, of theſe foundations, may well be called a <hi>dead faith,</hi> is becauſe it hath no other <hi>root,</hi> but what <hi>is rottenneſſe;</hi> it lives by no other principle of life, but what may be quenched, or taken from it, every hour, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may properly enough be ſaid to be <hi>dead, even whileſt it liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the Reaſon why the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Anti-Scripturiſts amongſt us, which now <hi>is not,</hi> was <hi>dead</hi> (in the ſenſe declared) even whileſt it was, is cleerly this; their negligence and unfaithfullneſſe unto their own ſouls, either in not inquiring after, or in not ſeriouſly and ſtudiouſly digeſting, ſuch conſiderations and grounds, which are proper and potent, againſt all oppoſitions of contrary reaſonings, arguments, and inducements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to eſtabliſh, root, ground, and build the judgements, ſouls, and conſciences of men, in aſſurance of the truth of the Goſpel, and of the iſſuings of the Scriptures from God. I well know that <hi>faith is</hi> (in Gods ſence) <hi>the guift of God;</hi> but know withall, that the reaſon why <hi>the ſeed, which fell in the ſtony ground,</hi> was <hi>ſcorebed with the heat of the ſun,</hi> was, becauſe <hi>it had not much earth</hi>

But as the <hi>diligent band</hi> is the way of his Providence moſt occupied, for his inriching of men with the ſilver and gold of this world; ſo is the thoughtfull, ſtudiouſly bent, and inquiring ſoul about the things of eternity, his ſtanding method, for his inriching of men with the <hi>true treaſure,</hi> and making them <hi>great</hi> through a ſound Faith, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And he that will not <hi>ſtrive to enter in by the ſtrait gate,</hi> is never like to be forced or thruſt into it by God.

            <p>Thus (good Reader) I have briefly drawn up for thy peruſall, the ſad Hiſtory, of the originall, progreſſe, and cataſtrophe or end of that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or vein of men amongſt us, who are fallen from a <hi>dead faith,</hi> to a <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deniall</hi> of the divine authority of the Scriptures.

<pb facs="tcp:111412:7"/> Treatiſe, notwithſtanding the image and ſuperſcription of the Authour ſo fully ſtamped upon it in deficiencies and infirmities, may be a commodious inſtrument in his hand for ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſubject it ſelf of the Treatiſe, the Demonſtration of the finger of God in the Scriptures, I ſhall not need either to commend, or to demonſtrate, the neceſſity of it, no not in reſpect of thoſe alſo, whoſe foot hath not as yet ſo much as begun to ſlide into the way of that abomination, which giveth away the glory of the <hi>onely</hi> infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> and holy God in the compoſure of them, to ſinfull, weak, and contemptible men. As there is much counterfeit and clip'd coin abroad in the world; ſo is there much Faith and belief of the Authority of the Scriptures in the hearts of men, which being touch'd, will be found baſe, and weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, light. <hi>The heart</hi> of a man <hi>is</hi> ſo dangerouſly, yea and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <hi>deceitfull,</hi> that, to ſave it ſelf a labour, and the ſweat of the brow in being conſtrained to beleeve indeed, by ſtrength of argument, and evidence of demonſtration, it will with much heat of confidence and importunity, violently perſwade him that he beleeveth already: and angerly demand of him (in <hi>Iudas</hi> his dialect) <hi>what needeth this waſte</hi> of time, in writing, and reading long diſcourſes,, to prove that, which thou approveſt already, and beleeveſt abundantly? Reader, it may be thou haſt heard of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> proverb, which tells thee that <hi>profered ware ſtinketh.</hi> Doubtleſſe that belief of ſupernaturall and Divine things, which thy heart, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, uncompelled, unconvinced, and this by an high hand of argument and ſolid demonſtration, in one kinde or other, profereth and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Meux ultroma pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet.</note> unto thee for good, for want of ſalt, can hardly be ſavoury, or ſound, or ſuch, wherein either God, or men, will much delight. But (reader) I would not have thee have <hi>ſorrow upon ſorrow,</hi> a long Diſcourſe upon a long Preface, or Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>I have now but only a little <hi>mint and aniſe</hi> to <hi>tith,</hi> two or three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of lighter conſequence to impart further unto thee, and ſo thou ſhalt no longer ſuffer in the bands of an Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I deſire to give thee notice, that according to the tenour of my firſt thoughts, onely four or five of the firſt ſheets of the Treatiſe (wherein, being thereunto compelled by the importune and un-man-like clamours of ſome, I attempt that otherwiſe needleſſe piece of curioſity, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as the Greek proverb well expreſſeth it, <hi>i. to make ſomewhat ſtraiter, then that which is ſtrait)</hi> together with the Epiſtle Dedicatory, were intended for the preſſe. In which reſpect, there are ſome paſſages, both in the ſaid Epiſtle, and within the compaſſe of theſe ſheets, which, being calculated according to the exigencie and poſture of things amongſt us ſo many months ſince, as the coming of them forth was projected, and expected, may now, by occaſion of the diſadvantage of ſo long-delaied a publication, ſeem ſomewhat incongruous, and leſſe ſeaſonable. In this behalf, I deſire the Readers courteſie for my accommodation; and that he will pleaſe for my relief herein, to borrow of his memory, if that be able to ſupply him herewith, the ſtate and tenour of his thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
<pb facs="tcp:111412:8"/> about the latter end of March laſt, as farre as they related to the contents of thoſe papers, when he reads them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When upon the perſwaſion of ſome friends, I had taken up this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall purpoſe, of enlarging the forementioned proportion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe onely with a ſummary and brief propoſall of the heads of thoſe conſiderations, which I had more largely inſiſted upon in the courſe of my Miniſtry, in order to the Vindication of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures; yea and had ſatisfied my ſelf accordingly, in the propoſall and ſetting down of one or two of the firſt of theſe conſiderations; yet going on to the reſt, I cleerly perceived, that their ſtrength and efficacie for the great ſervice intended, would have ſuffered much loſſe and diſadvantage in reference thereunto, if they had been confined to any narrower compaſſe of explication, then that which is now aſſigned unto them. In which reſpect, I was neceſſitated, to print them (at leaſt the greateſt part of them) as largely, as I Preached them; they who heard them Preached, and ſhall reade them Printed, will bear witneſſe, that very little alteration hath been made.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) my deſire to thee (and that more for thy own intereſt and benefit then for mine) is; that ſince the main body of the treatiſe, conſiſts of many arguments, and demonſtrations, to evince one and the ſame great concluſion and truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures are from God, though thou readeſt them ſingly one by one, and every one apart from his fellowes, yet in order to thy ſatisfaction about their ſtrength and ſufficiency to evince the ſaid concluſion, thou wilt look upon them all together, as one and the ſame intire demonſtration, and not conſult thine own dis-ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or diſcontent, where there is no juſt ground, or occaſion of either, as <hi>viz.</hi> by finding weakneſſe and unſatisfactorineſſe (poſſibly) in any one or more of them, taken out of their conjunction, which indeed is their ſtrength. <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this reaſon, why <hi>two are better then one, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but wo to him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, when he falleth.</hi> &amp;c.

A cable may be ſtrong and ſufficient to hold a good ſhip down laden againſt the ſtiffeſt guſt, and ſtrongeſt tempeſt of weather that can blow; and yet ſome one or two of the ſmalleſt threds or twiſts of it, may be brittle and half rotten. In like manner a diſcourſe, or body of arguments, raiſed for the demonſtration and proof of ſome important truth, may perform the engagement with power and authority, and be ſufficient to eſtabliſh the doubtfull, yea and to convince the gainſayer; though every thing delivered and aſſerted herein be not greater then exception, yea though ſome thing be obnoxious, and lieth open to the diſputes and contradictions of ſome men.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 21, 23.</note>, the holy Ghoſt himſelf thought it good, by the pen of the Evangeliſt, to rectifie the errour, only by ſetting down the words, in oppoſition to the interpretation, or miſtake; <hi>Yet Jeſus ſaid not unto him, he ſhall not die: but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> ſometimes, not only a ſpirit of enmity and envy, but of love it ſelf, may through an inadvertencie, and neglect to ingage ſecond thoughts, miſapprehend the genuine intent of what is ſpoken; yea and this in ſuch caſes, wherein the very repetition of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111412:14"/> word ſpoken, is ſufficient to evict the miſapprehenſion. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. To cleer the ſaid Section of any thing, either intended, or ſaid, againſt the Authority of the Scriptures; evident it is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was no part of my intent in the ſaid Section, nor any waies relating to the buſineſſe I had in hand, to declare mine own judgement, either in the affirmative or negative, concerning the Authority of the Scriptures; nor yet to put my Antagoniſts upon it to declare theirs in this; but only to ingage them, to declare plainly and diſtinctly, what they mean by the word, <hi>Scriptures,</hi> when they affirm and maintain <hi>the deniall of them to be the word of God to be</hi> an errour juſtly <hi>puniſhable with death.</hi> The Reaſon why I deſired to draw my adverſaries to this Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves, was, becauſe I apprehended (and doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſtill) that when they ſhall give a fair and reaſonable account of what is herein demanded, the unreaſonableneſſe of their aſſertion, wherein they maintain it as a matter worthy of death, to deny the <hi>Scriptures to be the word of God,</hi> will thereby more manifeſtly appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe I deſired that their explication in this kinde might be pertinent and proper, not frivolous, I judged it not amiſſe to attempt by argument, to put them by, or take them off from two explications, which I conceived they were moſt likely to pitch upon, either one, or both; both of them being impertinent to their occaſion. The former of the two from which I deſired to take them off, was; that by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they meant the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tranſlation; the later, the Originall Hebrew and Greek copies. From the former of theſe, I conceived I ſhould take them off upon this ground or conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>it is no foundation of Christian Religion, to beleeve that the Scriptures in this ſenſe</hi> or conſideration, <hi>are the word of God,</hi> i. (as I preſently explain my ſelf) that <hi>God spake to his Prophets or Apoſtles in Engliſh;</hi> I now adde, much leſſe that he ſpake unto either, in thoſe very words, phraſes, and ſentences in the Engliſh tongue, of which the ſyſteme or body of our Engliſh Tranſlation is made up. Who could have imagined, that ſuch an expreſſion, eſpecially in conjunction with ſuch an explication as this, would ever have been obnoxious to a ſiniſter interpretation? much leſſe be forced into any ſuch ſence, which ſhould imply a deniall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111412:14"/> of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures? Have not men of the moſt eminent learning and worth amongſt Proteſtants, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves upon the like occaſion in termes farre more liable to exception, then mine, and yet are blameleſſe? <hi>We</hi> (ſaith learned Doctor <hi>Whitaker) acknowledge no edition</hi> [of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures] <hi>authentique, [i.</hi> of Divine Authority,] <hi>but the Hebrew, in the old, and the Greek in the new Teſtament.

But it is one part of my preſent deſigne, to plead my cauſe with as much brevity, as the long furrows, which the ploughers have made upon my back, will any waies admit.</p>
            <p>Therefore having thus the buſh of Authority at our backs (in the next place) let us try it out with our Accuſers by the dint of a few compendious arguments whether the Engliſh Tranſlation of the Scriptures, be in every ſenſe, yea or in a proper ſenſe, the word of God, or any ſufficient foundation of Religion unto men. If upon cleerneſſe of debate it ſhall appear, that there is a ſenſe, and that obvious and plain enough, eſpecially if proper alſo, and moſt preciſely correſponding with the term, wherein the Engliſh-Tranſlation of the Scriptures, is not <hi>the word of God;</hi> then have thoſe men quitted themſelves moſt unworthy of men, and much more of Chriſtians, who having put an adulterate ſenſe of their own upon the ſaid Aſſertion, have laid the baſtard at my door; attempting with both their hands to build up their own Intereſts and honours, with the ruines and ſcattered ſtones of my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and have abuſed the ears both of Magiſtrates and people, with ſhameleſſe outeries and ſuggeſtions againſt me, as if I were a man of ſtrange opinions, an Aſſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111412:16"/> every point like unto themſelves; when as in deed and in truth (I ſpeak as in the preſence of God) the whole <hi>root of the matter,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Job 19. 28.</note> and intire cauſe of all this duſt, is nothing elſe but the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and irregular motions of their own fancies, working and beating and tearing themſelves this way and that, to catch ſome live ſly or other in my writings, which they may kill, and ſo put it, being dead, into my oyntment; that that ſavour of truth which it ſends forth, being a ſavour of death to their unworthy opinions and practiſes, may be made to ſtink in the noſtrills of men. I never denied, but have a thouſand times over affirmed, and by many Arguments and demonſtrations evinced the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the word of God; nay, I never denied, but now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that in a ſenſe (which I ſhall afterwards explain) even the <hi>Engliſh Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> it ſelf (and much more <hi>the Originalls)</hi> may be called <hi>the word of God.</hi> But that in ſtrictneſſe and exactneſſe of ſpeaking (which is the dialect I ſpeak in the ſaid controverted Section) the Engliſh Tranſlation is not <hi>the word</hi> of God, I preſume will be made as clear in truth, as the Sun is in light at noon day, by theſe enſuing demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If our Engliſh Tranſlation be the <hi>Scriptures or word of God, or the foundation of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> I deſire to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our laſt and neweſt Tranſlation, or that which was made at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or that of our old Church-Bibles, or that, ſet forth long ſince by M <hi>Tyndall,</hi> or any other particular Tranſlation in the Engliſh tongue (for there are ſeverall others, eſpecially of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe pieces of the Bible, beſides theſe) be theſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> this <hi>word of God,</hi> this <hi>foundation of Chriſtian Religion?</hi> To affirm that they are all and every one of them <hi>the word of God,</hi> and <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> is to make the word of God to diſſet from it ſelf, yea to make it incoherent, and in ſome things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it ſelf. For that every one of theſe Tranſlations reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively, differ from other, yea and in ſome places very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially; is a thing ſo well and generally known, to thoſe who have compared them; and ſo eaſie to be known unto others alſo, who will pleaſe but to take a little pains to inquire, that I judge it needleſſe to inſiſt upon any proof of it. To ſingle out any one of theſe Tranſlations, as ſuppoſe the laſt, and to ſet this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111412:16"/> crown of glory upon the head of it (with the rejection of it's fellows) <hi>this is the Scripture, the word of God, the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, and none other,</hi> is of dangerous conſequence many waies; and (I preſume) will not be juſtified by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation be the word of God, the foundation of Chriſtian Religion</hi> &amp;c. then was there no <hi>word of God,</hi> no <hi>foundation of Christian Religion,</hi> before the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>Tranſlated into Engliſh:</hi> for certain it is, that nothing is, or can be, before it ſelf or it's own being.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation be the word of God, and ſo the foundation of Religion;</hi> then all profeſſours of Chriſtianity thorowout the world, who are ignorant of the Engliſh tongue, and do not build their Faith upon the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> build beſides the true <hi>foundation, the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation be the word of God, and foundation of Religion,</hi> why not the <hi>Dutch, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſlation, as well as it (with all others?) If every of theſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> be the Scriptures, the <hi>word of God,</hi> &amp;c. as well as the Engliſh, then do the <hi>Scriptures and the word of God</hi> really differ from themſelves: for there is nothing more evident, then that theſe <hi>Tranſlations</hi> really differ one from another, the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective languages wherein they are framed, really differing one from another.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation be the word of God, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> &amp;c. then may there be, yea and are, many errours <hi>in the word of God, and in the foundation of Religion.</hi> For that there are many errours and miſtakes in all and every our <hi>Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> is a thing undeniable.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If <hi>our Engliſh Tranſlation be the word of God, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> &amp;c. then the Originall. <hi>Hebrew and Greek copies,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wherein they differ in ſenſe and import of matter from our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> (as in many places they do) are not the <hi>word of God, nor foundation of Religion.</hi> For <hi>the word of God</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts no difference in it ſelf, nor are <hi>the foundations of Religion</hi> divided in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The word of God, which the Apoſtle command's <hi>Titus</hi> to hold forth in his preaching, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>i. a ſound word, which cannot be condemned</hi> or reproved, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 8. But our Engliſh Tranſlation, is not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, every way ſound, or irreproveable, or ſo ſound that it cannot be reproved. Therefore it is not the word of God.</p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>The word of God</hi> (properly taken) is that <hi>word,</hi> which all Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to <hi>preach;</hi> and to be <hi>inſtant (viz.</hi> in preaching it) <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon</hi> (as the Apoſtle injoines <hi>Timothy)</hi> But all Miniſters of the Goſpel, are not bound to preach the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> (nor indeed any Miniſter at all, at leaſt by any order, or injunction by God) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> certainly is not <hi>the word of God</hi> in a proper ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>The word of God, is that word of Truth</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <note n="a" place="margin">Jam. 1. 18.</note>) and <hi>that incorruptible ſeed</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, If no <hi>Tranſlation</hi> whatſoever, nor any, either written, or printed copie whatſoever, be <hi>the word of God,</hi> or <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> certainly <hi>our Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> cannot challenge this honour; but rather thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> copies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written, or printed, which are called, Originall. Now that theſe are not properly the <hi>word of God, nor foundation of Religion,</hi> is evident, 1. Becauſe the word of God had a being, and was extant in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> in the hearts and conſciences of men, before there was any copie of this word extant in writing, either in the one language, or the other. Now that which is in being, or hath a being before another, cannot be ſaid to be that other thing which followeth after. <hi>Moſes</hi> is generally acknowledged by us to be the firſt penman of <hi>the Scriptures, or word of God;</hi> and that the world had continued more then 2000. years before he was born. But to affirm that there was no <hi>word of God,</hi> in the world, no <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> for the ſpace of 2000. years and upwards, is to contradict that which is plainly, and in many places aſſerted, in the written word of God. Beſides, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it ſelf was in the world, and beleeved on in the world, before any of the Evangeliſts put forth their hand to that bleſſed work, of putting into writing the ſumme and ſubſtance of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111412:17"/> their writings cannot properly be called the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpel had a compleat being and exiſtence in the world, whilſt as yet they were not. 2. Becauſe there are many differences, and might poſſibly have been, and yet may be, many more, in, and between thoſe Hebrew, and Greek copies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which yet are indifferently and with equall reverence on all hands, all termed, the <hi>Originalls;</hi> yea the beſt, and trueſt, and moſt genuine of them, may in time, either thorough the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or negligence, or malice, whether of Scribes, or Printers, or over-ſeers of preſſes, or all, be corrupted: but the word of God, properly ſo called, is alwaies pure, univerſally true, and incorruptible. 3. And laſtly, becauſe no man can have any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that either the Scribe, or Printer, of any of the Originall copies, now extant in the world, whether Hebrew, or Greek, was either infallibly directed, or extraordinarily aſſiſted from Heaven, either in the tranſcribing, or in the printing of them. Now no writing, or ſyſteme of words and ſentences whatſoever, which a man cannot reaſonably, and upon good grounds judge and conclude, to have been committed to paper by ſpeciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and warrant from God, can or ought to be a <hi>foundation of Religion</hi> unto him, or looked upon as the indubitable <hi>word of God.</hi> And this (I truſt) will abundantly ſerve to clear and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that expreſſion (ſo much quarrelled at) wherein I deny the <hi>Engliſh Scriptures</hi> or <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> to be the <hi>foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Religion,</hi> or <hi>the word of God:</hi> which was the former expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the two, from which my deſire was, in the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Section, to divert my Antagoniſts (as before was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the latter explication, which I alſo conceiv'd they might very poſſibly have chopt upon, the tenour of it was this, That by the word <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in the ſaid opinion made puniſhable by the Ordinance with death, they mean the <hi>Originall Hebrew and Greek copies,</hi> out of which <hi>(it is ſaid, and I beleeve)</hi> our <hi>Engliſh Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Tranſlations,</hi> have been taken and made. From this explication of themſelves, I thought I might readily, and with abundance of conviction, take them off, by this conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>there are very few men in the Kingdome, not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, that underſtand either of theſe languages;</hi> I now adde, no,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111412:18"/> nor yet know ſo much as whether there be any ſuch languages or no, but onely by hear-ſay, and upon the credit of men; and conſequently, cannot know, but upon the ſame terms, or ground of belief, whether there be any ſuch <hi>Originall Copies</hi> or no; much leſſe can they know, but ſtill upon the ſame fallible grounds, that the matter, or ſubſtance of things expreſſed in the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> was taken out of, or is conteined in, the ſaid copies. Now to make it a crime puniſhable with death, for men to deny ſuch writings or books to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> which they have no more reaſon or ground to judge to be ſo, but only common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or the bare aſſertions of men, will (I beleeve) upon due conſideration be found altogether inconſiſtent with thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equity, which ought to rule in all legiſlation, or making of Laws. For very poſſible it is, that he may truly, and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſavingly beleeve the Scriptures, that is, that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>the word of God,</hi> to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> who yet ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any Originall copie, whether <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> now extant in the world, to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> at leaſt, properly and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, that is, ſo to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> as to have no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corruption, or of that which is not <hi>the word of God,</hi> in it. Yea the truth is, that in this ſenſe, they, who both have the greateſt skill, and inſight into the Originall languages, yea and who beleeve the Scriptures unto ſalvation, cannot upon any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, at leaſt not upon any infallible ground beleeve any Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall copie whatſoever under heaven, whether Hebrew, or Greek, to be <hi>the word of God:</hi> yea, I have yet to add, that which is more then all this; Suppoſe the very <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the very ſame copies, which were written with the hand of the holy penmen of the Scriptures themſelves, were yet extant; yea and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly known, to be ſo; yet except it were infallibly known alſo, that they were no waies corrupted, raſed, or interlin'd, ſince they came from the hands of the ſaid Pen-men, no perſon whatſoever were able infallibly to ſay and conclude, that theſe (in the ſenſe ſpecified) are <hi>the word of God.</hi> The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the word of God</hi> (in the ſaid proper ſenſe) is intirely, and univerſally, in all, and in every part of it, pure, and incorrupt, like God himſelf; therefore ſuch copies or Tranſcripts, which are in any part corrupt, are not <hi>the word of God</hi> (in this ſenſe)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111412:18"/> and ſuch which are not infallibly known to be univerſally incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, cannot (in the ſaid ſenſe) be infallibly known to be <hi>the word of God.</hi> Yea <hi>the word of God</hi> (in the ſenſe now argued) being not only intirely, univerſally, and in every part of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, but alſo proportionably uncapable of corruption, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply incorruptible; evident it is, that no writing or tranſcript whatſoever, though infallibly known to contain nothing in it for the preſent, but <hi>the word of God,</hi> can yet (in the ſaid ſenſe) be truly called <hi>the word of God,</hi> becauſe though it be uncorrupt, yet it is not incorruptible. And this (I truſt) is ſufficient, yea and ſuper-ſufficient, to ſtop the mouth of that weakneſſe (that I ſay not, wickedneſſe) which hath been ſo wide opened in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming an inoffenſive and moſt innocent paſſage, ſpeaking nothing but words of ſoberneſſe and of truth, as guilty of a moſt foul and horrid crime.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to wipe off that importune aſperſion of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of the Scriptures to be Divine, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of my peace (yet not ſo much of mine, as of their own) are ſtill in a reſtleſſe manner caſting upon me; I ſhall plainly and briefly here give an account unto the world of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well in the negative, as affirmative, concerning the Scriptures, and their Authority; as likewiſe concerning Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture (in the generall) and ſhall further declare my ſenſe (though very briefly alſo) touching the originalls. I ſhall deliver my ſelf as touching all theſe particulars, in certain brief poſitions, or concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> be meant the matter and ſubſtance of things conteined and held forth in the books of the old and new Teſtament, commonly known amongſt Proteſtants by the name of <hi>Canonicall,</hi> I fully and with all my heart and all my ſoul beleeve them to be of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and none other then <hi>the word of God;</hi> and (God aſſiſting) ſhall rather expoſe my ſelf to a thouſand deaths, then deny them ſo to be. As for example; I fully and abſolutely beleeve, that theſe aſſertions (with the like expreſſed in the ſame writing with them) 1. That Jeſus Chriſt is God. 2. That he is the Son of God. 3. He was made man. 4. That he died for the ſalvation of the world, that he roſe again from the dead, that whoſoever beleeves on him
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111412:19"/> ſhall be ſaved; that whoſoever beleeves not on him, ſhall be condemned (with a thouſand more beſides) all theſe aſſertions (I ſay) I fully and abſolutely beleeve, not only to be Truths, but Truths of ſpeciall revelation from God unto the world. I have lately imparted unto many others, and that at large, the grounds of my belief and confidence in this kinde: the brief heads of which grounds, I have annexed to this preſent diſcourſe, in the cloſe of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if by <hi>Scriptures</hi> be meant, all the letters, ſyllables, words, phraſes, ſentences, and periods of ſpeech, expreſſed in the ſaid books, called <hi>Canonicall,</hi> whether Tranſlated, or in theſe Originalls (I mean in ſuch, either Hebrew or Greek copies, as are commonly extant, and uſed amongſt us) I know no ground why I ſhould beleeve them to be <hi>the word of God;</hi> that is; why I ſhould beleeve, that all, and every the ſaid ſyllables, words, phraſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in any ſpeciall or extraordinary way given, or appointed by God, to convey thoſe ſpirituall truths and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto the underſtandings and mindes of men, which he hath been graciouſly pleaſed to reveal from heaven, for their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Concerning Tranſlations, the caſe is more clear; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of theſe, but which carry the manifeſt marks of humane oſcitancie and weakneſſe in them. Concerning ſuch Originalls, as were mentioned; firſt, though for the Hebrew copies, it is more probable (of the two) that all the ſyllables, words, and phraſes in theſe, are the ſame, unto which the Originall Pen-men of theſe writings, were in ſpeciall manner directed by God; yet I know no law, either of Reaſon, or Religion, that binds me to beleeve, that no Tranſcriber of them out of their firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, no Printer of them out of theſe Tranſcripts, ever failed, or miſcarried after the manner of men, in theſe negotiations. So that as on the one hand, I dare not ſay, but that in ſome of theſe copies, there may be all things, even to words, ſyllables, and letters, of divine inſpiration; ſo on the other I cannot be confident, that they are. As for the Originall Greek copies, it is generally known to thoſe, who have compared ſeverall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them together, that there are many differences and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of readings, and ſome of them ſomewhat conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween copie and copie, edition and edition. Now certain it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111412:19"/> that God, who is <hi>the Authour of peace, and not of confuſion,</hi> did not order or direct his firſt pen-men of this part of the Scriptures, to publiſh different copies of thoſe things, which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſtirred up and appointed by him to impart by writing unto the world. Nor is it any matter of Faith, perhaps not of prudence, where editions and copies varie, and are at odds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, to interpoſe by way of poſitive umpirage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, upon any ſuch terms, as to determine and conclude, that this, or that, or any other determinately, runs parallell in all things, and without the leaſt variation, with the prototype, or firſt copie it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though I do not beleeve, that any Originall exemplar or copie of the Scriptures, now extant amongſt us, is ſo purely <hi>the word of God,</hi> but that it may very poſſibly, have a mixture, or at leaſt a tincture, of the word of men in it, yet I confidently beleeve, that the Providence of God, and the love which he bears to his own glory, as well in the condemnation of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unbeleevers, as in the ſalvation of his choſen, have ſo far interpoſed and watched over the great and gracious diſcovery and Revelation which he made of himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt unto the world, that thoſe books or writings, wherein it was in all the branches and particularities at firſt imparted unto the world, neither as yet have ſuffered, nor ever ſhall ſuffer, any ſuch viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mutilation, or falſification in any kinde, either thorough the ignorance, negligence, or malice of men, but that they will be able, ſufficiently, yea abundantly to furniſh the world, men of all ſorts and conditions, with the knowledge of all things, neceſſary to be known, either for their honourable and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an deportment in this preſent world, or for their everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and exaltation in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, concerning Tranſlations, though I judge none of them to be <hi>the word of God</hi> (in the ſenſe lately argued againſt) that is, the pure <hi>word of God,</hi> without any imbaſement at all by that which is humane; nor yet in ſuch a ſenſe, as the Originall copies may be called <hi>the word of God,</hi> which do not only expreſſe and hold forth the revealed will, or minde of God, as Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (at leaſt in part) do, but hold them forth in that very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and for the moſt part (if not altogether) in the ſelf ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111412:20"/> individuall words and phraſes, wherein God himſelf directed the publication of them by writing, unto the world, which Tranſlations do not; yet I judge them one of the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God ever vouchſafed unto the nations, and Gentile part of the world; and conceive, that though they do not (even the beſt of them) expreſſe the will and minde of God, in that language or ſameneſſe of words, wherein God ordered the firſt publication of them by writing; no nor yet ſo intirely, thorowly, purely, or emphatically, as the Originalls do; yet they generally (even the worſt and moſt imperfect of them, that I know) expreſſe and hold forth ſo much of the minde, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and will of God, by the true knowledge and underſtanding whereof, men may be brought to <hi>live godlily, and righteouſly, and ſoberly</hi> in this preſent world, and conſequently, to <hi>that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and undefiled inheritance which is reſerved in the Heavens</hi> for thoſe that beleeve.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, though I judge no Tranſlation whatſoever, either for gracefullneſſe of language, ſignificancie of terms, majeſty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (with the like) to be equall to the Originall Hebrew and Greek; yet I conceive that there is no Tranſlation ſo farre degenerate or ſo diſadvantagiouſly compil'd, but that carrieth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſomewhat differing by way of excellencie from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, in the phraſe and language thereof; yea that which is ſufficient, by the ordinary bleſſing of God upon a conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intent reading, or conſideration of it, to evince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the matter conteined in it, to be from God, as a ſeal of armes upon the outſide of a letter, is ſufficient to diſcover from what perſon of honour the matter or contents of the letter come. Yet</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I conceive the matter of the Scriptures, I mean thoſe glorious and Divine Truths, thoſe holy and righteous commands, thoſe great and precious promiſes, thoſe aſtoniſhing and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threatnings, conteined and expreſſed, as well in Tranſlations, as in the Originalls to be of greateſt pregnancie and power both to diſcover and aſſert their royall Parentage, and deſcent from God. <hi>If our Goſpel</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be hid</hi> (1. undiſcern'd, or not apprehended to come from God) <hi>it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:111412:20"/> which beleeve not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor 4 3, 4.</note>. In which words he clearly implies, that there is ſuch a glorious and heavenly luſtre, or brightneſſe of divine excellencie, ſitting (as it were) upon, and ſhining from, the face of the Goſpel, that men, who are not <hi>bewitched</hi> by the devil, that is, who are not through the juſt judgement of God upon them for former ſins deprived by the devil even of the naturall uſe or actings of their reaſons, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and underſtandings, about ſpirituall things, cannot but ſee and acknowledge, manifeſt characters and impreſſions of the grace, holineſſe, love, and wiſedome of God in it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be hereby drawn to imbrace it. Therefore</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, the true and proper <hi>foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> is not inke and paper, not any book, or books, not any writing, or writings whatſoever, whether <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalls;</hi> but that ſubſtance of matter, thoſe gracious counſells of God concerning the ſalvation of the world by Jeſus Chriſt, which indeed are repreſented, and declared, both in Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Originalls, but are eſſentially and really diſtinct from both, and no waies, for their natures and beings, depending on either of them. A bargain agreed upon, and concluded, in point of tranſaction, between two men, whether the tenour or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of it be ever drawn up in writing, or ſubſcribed by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or no, is yet for the nature of it, and matter of tranſaction, a compleat and true bargain; the writing, if any be made in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it, onely declareth the nature or tenour of the bargain, which was in reality, and compleatneſſe of being, before the writing; and conſequently the writing can be no part of it: In like manner, the gracious and good pleaſure of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſalvation of the world, had in all the particulars of it, compleatneſſe of being, <hi>viz.</hi> in God himſelf, long before any branch or part of it was imparted unto the world by any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whatſoever; yea and was ſavingly imparted, and revealed unto the world, 1. By immediate inſpiration from God unto ſome men, 2. by word of mouth, from theſe, unto many others, long before any part of it was ordered by God to be ſet down in writing. So that no book, or writing whatſoever, is either in whole, or in part, this <hi>word,</hi> or will of God; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111412:21"/> 
               <hi>no foundation of Chriſtian Religion;</hi> unleſſe we ſhall ſuppoſe and make ſome other <hi>foundation of</hi> this <hi>Religion,</hi> beſides <hi>the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This concluſion is further evidenced by this conſideration. The <hi>foundation of true Religion,</hi> is not changed, varieth not from it ſelf, by any intervalls, or diſtances of times, but like Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is one <hi>and the ſame, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note>. Now certain it is, that there was a time, where neither Originalls, nor Tranſlations of Scripture, were <hi>the foundation of Religion,</hi> but ſomewhat beſides; therefore as certain it is, that neither are they the <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> at this day. That there was a time, when neither of them was any <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what hath been already ſaid, and is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. There was a true <hi>Religion</hi> in the world, all along that great ſpace or tract of time (two thouſands years and more) which had gone over the head of the world, before <hi>Moſes</hi> was called and imployed by God, to lay the corner ſtone of that Divine fabrique of Scripture, which is now (and ſo hath been of a long time) perfected; unleſſe we will deny, <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to have been <hi>truly Religious,</hi> with many others, who lived within that compaſſe of time, and have teſtimony from the Scriptures themſelves, that they were godly and faithfull. Yea the Goſpel it ſelf, and thoſe further and rich diſcoveries of himſelf, which God reſerved for a glorious gift to be preſented (as it were) by Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the world at his coming into it, were effectually preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and beleeved by many unto ſalvation, and Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fully eſtabliſhed in the world, before any part of the new Teſtament was written. The Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> is generally conceived (eſpecially by ancient writers) to have been the firſt pen-man, that God was pleas'd to uſe in penning the new Teſtament; and that it was about eight years after <hi>Chriſts</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, before he put forth his hand to this work. And yet who doubts but that <hi>the foundation of Chriſtian Religion</hi> was laid before this in the world; yea and much of this <hi>Religion</hi> built upon it? Therefore (queſtionleſſe) no writing whatſoever whether <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> or <hi>Originalls,</hi> are <hi>the foundation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111412:21"/>
            <p>There are other reaſons, and theſe in abundance, very obvious, and near at hand, of an undeniable eviction of truth in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; but the conſidering Reader cannot lightly by this, ſtand in need of any thing more to be ſaid for his ſatisfaction in the point.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; but what ground or <hi>foundation</hi> can a weak and unlearned man have, to build his Faith or <hi>Religion</hi> upon, if he may not ſafely build it upon ſuch a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the Scriptures, as he underſtands? And of what uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit are <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> yea or <hi>Originalls</hi> themſelves, if men may not build their <hi>Religion</hi> on them, as upon a ſure and ſafe <hi>foundation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the former part of the Queſtion, I anſwer, 1. That if he who is able to read and underſtand the Scriptures onely in his own native tongue, hath no foundation to build his Faith or <hi>Religion</hi> upon, but onely that <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of Scripture, which he is able to read and underſtand; then he that is altogether book-leſſe and illiterate, and not able to read the Scriptures, though tranſlated into his own language, hath no foundation at all, for his. The reaſon of the conſequence is clear; becauſe to him that cannot read Engliſh, an Engliſh Bible is as much a <hi>ſealed,</hi> or uſeleſſe <hi>book,</hi> in reſpect of his perſonall reading it, as a Bible Tranſlated into a ſtrange language, is to him, who is able to read the Engliſh tongue, and none other. But certain it is, that many Engliſh, both men and women, who cannot read En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and conſequently not an Engliſh Bible, finde notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a ſufficient foundation whereon to build their Faith and Religion, being ſound Beleevers, and truly <hi>Religious.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alſo, who are able both to read and underſtand the Engliſh Tranſlation, and no other, either have, or may have, I am ſure ought to have, another foundation, on which to build their Religion, beſides their Engliſh Tranſlation; <hi>viz.</hi> that Truth of God, which is indifferently contained and expreſſed both in Originalls, and other Tranſlations alſo, beſides the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; and on which many build their Religion, and that ſafely, who neither know, nor depend upon, either the one, or the other, I mean neither upon <hi>Originalls,</hi> nor <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> either in one language or other.</p>

            <p>Secondly, If unlearned men amongſt us have no foundation to build their <hi>Religion</hi> upon, but onely the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation;</hi> then <hi>the foundation of their Religion</hi> muſt unavoidably, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be, that which is the product and fruit of the wiſedome, learning, and underſtanding of men. For certain it is that all Tranſlations of Scriptures in what language ſoever, are none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Holy Ghoſt never intereſſing himſelf, at leaſt in a way of infallibility, or any other wiſe, then according to the line and meaſure of his uſuall aſſiſtance of faithfull miniſters in the courſe of their preaching, about any <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Therefore certainly ſuch men (I mean, that are unlearned) have another foundation, beſides the Engliſh Tranſlation, whereon to build themſelves in point of Religion, even the infallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Truth of God; which was a foundation of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to many unlearned ones, before the Engliſh Tranſlation was brought forth, or heard of in the world.</p>
            <p>If it be yet urged; yea but is not this Truth of God, which you acknowledge to be ſo juſt and ſure a <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> ſomewhat at leaſt, or a part of the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you grant, that it is conteined and expreſſed in it. And if ſo, then is this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> at leaſt in reſpect of a part of it, or of ſomewhat in it, a ſure and ſafe <hi>foundation of Religion.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By conceſſion; that that Truth of God, which I aſſert for the true <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> is contained and expreſſed (though it be with ſome diſadvantage) in the <hi>Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer further (by way of exception) though that truth of God, is indeed the <hi>true foundation of Religion,</hi> which is contained and expreſſed in the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not from hence, that therefore it is any part of it. Wine or other liquor may be contain'd, preſented, or held forth in a cup; yet hereby it never the more becomes any part of the cup, which contain's and hold's it forth.</p>
            <p>If it be yet ſaid; yea but is not the ſenſe, meaning and import, of a writing, or book, a part, yea the moſt materiall part, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And is not the <hi>Truth of God</hi> you ſpeak of, the true and genuine ſenſe, meaning, and import of the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation?</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:111412:22"/> and ſo by conſequence, a part of it? I anſwere:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is not altogether the ſame reaſon or conſideration of Tranſlations of books, or writings in any kinde, wherein one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſenſe and meaning of another is expreſſed (or at leaſt intended ſo to be) which there is of books containing onely the judgement, ſenſe, and apprehenſions of him, who is the Authour. The union between the words, and ſenſe or meaning in the later kinde of books, is more formall and entire, then in the former: and conſequently the ſenſe or meaning contained in them, may more properly be called <hi>a part</hi> of them, then in the other. There is a kinde of union between the cup, and the wine that is put into it, and contained in it, as well as there is between the body and ſoul, in the perſon of a man; but yet the former union doth not, of the two things united, conſtitute any thing ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely one, as the later doth. The body and ſoul, by means of their union, conſtitute a third thing differing from them both, which is naturally, compleatly, and eſſentially one <hi>(viz.</hi> the perſon of a man) of which, as well the body, as the ſoul, and again, the ſoul, as well as the body, may properly be called, <hi>parts.</hi> But no ſuch third thing, <hi>viz.</hi> which is naturally and intirely one, is raiſed by the other union, which is between the wine and the cup: nor can the wine be called properly a part of any third thing, conſtituted or made of it, and the cup, in conjunction with it. The reaſon of the difference is, becauſe this later uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the wine and the cup, is of a lower nature, more extrinſecall and looſe, then to combine the two things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it relateth, into one and the ſame intire body, or ſubſtance. In like manner, when a man inditeth and frameth a book of his own, wherein he onely expreſſeth his own ſenſe, conceptions, or notions of things; there is a more genuine, naturall, and intire union, between the ſenſe and the words, then is between the ſenſe, and the words of a book Tranſlated. The words and ſenſe in the former kinde of writing, proceed joyntly and with an intireneſſe of union, out of one and the ſame underſtanding, much after the ſame manner, wherein the ſoul and the body come in perſonall union out of the womb. But in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a book it is otherwiſe; the ſenſe, matter, and import of this, is profeſſedly taken or borrowed from another book or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111412:23"/> writing, which came from another underſtanding, not his, who is the tranſlatour; and conſequently, is but a ſtranger (compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively) to thoſe words, or that language, into which it is tranſlated. From which difference it cometh to paſſe, that the ſenſe of a Tranſlation, or book tranſlated out of another, cannot ſo properly be called a part of this book, as the ſenſe of a book, wholly rais'd, words, and matter, out of the ſame judgement and underſtanding, may. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it be granted, that a part, or ſomewhat of our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> is a juſt and ſafe <hi>foundation of Religion,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe and meaning of it (as hath been ſaid) yet in a formall conſideration, that is, <hi>as</hi> it is part of this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> it is not, it ought not ſo to be. For if it be in this reſpect a <hi>foundation of Religion, viz</hi> becauſe it is a part of the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> then the reaſon, judgement, faithfullneſſe and skill in languages in the Tranſlatour, are the principall ingredients into the <hi>foundation of Religion.</hi> For that ſenſe, matter, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of things expreſſed in this Tranſlation, though they be (for the moſt part) the Truth, or Truths of God, yet were they not brought hither (I mean, put into, or made part of this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſimply <hi>as</hi> they are the Truth, or Truths of God, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were conceived and apprehended for ſuch, by the Tranſlatour, and ſuppoſed to be the true and genuine ſenſe of the Originalls, from whence they were conveyed by him, and put into the Engliſh tongue. So that whoſoever ſhall build or <hi>found</hi> his <hi>Religion</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> ſimply as ſuch, as a Tranſlation (which properly import's onely the work, or atchievement of a man) builds this important fabrique upon the ſandy foundations, of the knowledge, skill, wiſedome, and faithfullneſſe of men. But he that builds upon the Truth and counſells of God concerning the ſalvation of men by Jeſus Chriſt, whether expreſſed in the ſaid <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> or in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls,</hi> or whereſoever, builds his <hi>Religion</hi> (like the <hi>wiſe builder) upon the Rock,</hi> and upon ſuch a <hi>foundation</hi> which ſhall not be ſhaken; whether the Engliſh Tranſlation ſtand, or fall. And this for Anſwer, to the former part of the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>To the later, which queſtioneth the uſe of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> in caſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111412:23"/> unlearned men may not ſafely make them the <hi>foundation</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> I anſwer; firſt (in the generall) that the uſe and benefit of them is exceeding great, and that ſeverall waies, though that uſe (which is indeed an abuſe of them, and which makes them of equall authority with the incorruptible word of God it ſelf) be denied unto them. Yea I conceive that that miraculous and glorious gift of tongues, given to the Apoſtles in the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>(Acts</hi> 2.) though of a moſt gracious and very high concernment unto the world, yet was not of that rich and bleſſed accommodation to the generality of man-kinde, which Tranſlations of Scripture are. For (to deſcend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the ſecond place) there are theſe enſuing conſiderations (amongſt others,) wherein Tranſlations of Scripture, are great benefactours unto the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They exhibit, and repreſent the great things of God and of Jeſus Chriſt concerning the ſalvation of men, unto the mindes and conſciences of weak and unlearned men, whoſe education, condition, and courſe of life, have not afforded unto them ſo much clerk-ſhip, or ſcholar-like learning, as to be able to reade with underſtanding, any more tongues or languages, then that wherein they were born. By means of which repreſentation by Tranſlations, they have opportunity, as oft as they ſhall deſire, to exerciſe themſelves with more advantage and facilitie, either in the meditation, or further ſtudy of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men who have been bowed down ſo neer unto the earth in their education, that they are not able to read ſo much as their own native language, may yet have more, and more frequent communion and converſe with the great things of their peace, being brought into a language which they underſtand, then they could have had opportunity to enjoy, had they ſtill been confined to the Originals. Many can reade the Scriptures unto them in their mother tongue, who are not able to reade, much leſſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, the Originall languages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Tranſlation, if it ſuffers not, either through the unskillfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or unfaithfullneſſe, of the Tranſlators, doth not only convey the preciſe ſence and import of the originall text to the Readers underſtanding, but ſerve inſtead of a brief Commentary or expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:111412:24"/>4. When there is <hi>a famine of the word of God,</hi> in reſpect of the publike teaching and miniſtry of it, or when men are deprived of liberty or opportunity to partake of it in that ordinance, the company of a faithfull Tranſlation of the Scriptures, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to a comfortable ſupply of theſe ſpirituall inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and defects, by the generality of men, who are not capable of the originals.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A good and approved Tranſlation in the hand of a plain, and yet conſidering man (a frequent conjunction in theſe daies) ſerves him inſtead of a touchſtone to try the Doctrine of his Teacher, whether it be <hi>gold and ſilver,</hi> or hey and ſtubble: and ſo may be a means (through the bleſſing of God) to deliver his precious ſoul, out of the ſnare of thoſe, who corrupt and make merchandiſe of the word of God; a ſeed of men, which Satan of late hath ſowne very thick in the field of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Many Miniſters and Teachers themſelves ſtand in awe of Tranſlations in the hand of their hearers, and people committed unto them, leſt they ſhould be reproved and cenſured by them, in caſe they approve not themſelves ſuch <hi>workmen, who need not be aſhamed.</hi> The <hi>Bereans ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether things were ſo, or no,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had taught them <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 17. 11.</note>: which they could not have done, had they not had that precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Scriptures in a language which they underſtood.</p>
            <p n="7">7. (And laſtly,) Many thouſands of ſouls, who cannot fetch the waters of life from the fountains themſelves (I mean the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals) nor drink here: may yet drink freely of them, and quench their thirſt, when they are derived and brought from hence to their hearts and underſtandings, by the pipes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of ſound Tranſlations. Yea and by acquainting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Scriptures privately, and in their own houſes, they may be more apprehenſive and capable of the publike adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, in the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars might eaſily have been enlarged, and the great weight and importance of them all reſpectively, more fully opened, urged, and inſiſted upon; yea many more of equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment with theſe, might readily have been added; but theſe I judge abundantly ſufficient, to vindicate the neceſſity, uſe, benefit, and bleſſing of Tranſlations unto the world, though
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111412:24"/> no <hi>foundation of Religion</hi> be made of them.</p>
            <p>By this time I truſt the Reader will acknowledge, that labour enough (if not complain, that more then enough) hath been expended, in waſhing that, which was clean before; and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrait, that which was no waies crooked. But it is no rarity amongſt the ſtories and paſſages of the world, to hear, or ſee, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice put upon her juſtification. If I did not know <hi>Satan</hi> to be an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> one that <hi>cannot change his skin,</hi> I ſhould not fear <hi>the returning of the clouds after the rain;</hi> I mean, the bearing of the reproach of a man denying the Divine Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, any more.</p>
            <p>I cannot but here take notice, of ſome other lying and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating ſpirits abroad in the world againſt me, before the date of the Commiſſion, which this laſt and fouleſt of the brood, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to enter the mouthes and tongues of men. Yet I perceive that that great Father, of whom we ſpake before <hi>(Auguſtine</hi> by name) in whom <hi>the grace of God wrought mightily,</hi> for the advancement of the Name and Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the world, was haunted and moleſted with many more of theſe unclean ſpirits, then yet I have been. For he, in the forementioned Tract, found himſelf <hi>neceſſitated, partly to mollifie his accuſers and tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, partly to rectifie the apprehenſions of thoſe, in whoſe ears thoſe miſ-repreſentations of him had ſounded,</hi> to vindicate and purge himſelf, about no fewer then <hi>ſixteen</hi> ſeverall points, wherein he had ſuffered diſparagement and diſgrace by the tongues of ſome, as an erroneous man <note n="a" place="margin">Unde ne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus querelę in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniretur oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſ<expan>

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:111412:25"/>
            <p>The firſt of the four is, that I hold, <hi>that naturall men may do ſuch things, as whereunto God hath by way of promiſe annexed Grace, and acceptation.</hi> A moſt dangerous errour! and of as ſad a conſequence, as that which was charged upon <hi>Paul,</hi> when his adverſaries accuſed him for teaching, <hi>That they were no gods, which were made with hands.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 19. 26.</note>. For (doubtleſſe) men, are <hi>naturall</hi> men, before they are ſpirituall, or ſupernaturall; and ſpirituall or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall they cannot be made, but by beleeving; and unto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, we all confeſſe, that <hi>God hath promiſed grace and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Therefore unleſſe it be poſſible, that <hi>naturall</hi> men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; it is unpoſſible that ever they ſhould become ſpirituall.

            <p>As for the reports of ſome others, who defile their tongues and conſciences together, by charging me behinde my back, that I make Faith without an object to juſtifie, that I make Faith to juſtifie as it is an act, that I make a bare belief of the Goſpel to juſtifie, that I deſire not to be found in Chriſts righteouſneſſe; with many ſuch ridiculous forgeries as theſe, I look upon them onely as the eſſaies of Satan, or that ſmall game which he had rather play (as the proverb is) then ſit out. For my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and hope in the moſt important buſineſſe of my Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God, I cannot expreſſe it either with more ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my ſelf, or (as I conceive) unto others, then in the tenour of the Apoſtles own words: I deſire, and hope, <hi>to he found in him</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>not having mine own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith</hi>

            <p>The third and fourth errours (very ſimply and erroneouſly ſo called) which <hi>Hell</hi> chargeth me with, have been already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned, and perfectly reconciled unto the Truth, in the former paſſages of this diſcourſe. However, let us have the ſound of them, that ſo we may perceive with what fidelitie, and skill, he that is the Collectour for <hi>Hell,</hi> hath performed his Office, in making the Extraction of them out of my pen.</p>
            <p>The former of the two, tenoureth thus: <hi>That as it is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Religion, to beleeve that the Engliſh Scriptures, or that volume, or volume of books called the Bible, are the word of God: ſo neither thoſe that are learned, nor thoſe that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can know that the Originall Hebrew or Greek copies are the word of God, upon any better terms of aſſurance, then the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, common report, or Authority of men.</hi> Doth the man repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as an errour, to hold, that the act of a man, as <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>beleeving the Engliſh Scriptures to be the word of God,</hi> is <hi>no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Religion?</hi> The Lord in mercy ſend his Church better Tutours and Teachers then theſe.</p>
            <p>The later, is but another of the ſame, being this: <hi>That the holding the Scripture,</hi> i. <hi>either the Originall or Greek copies (out of which the Engliſh Bible is tranſlated) or the Engliſh Bible to be the word of God, can with no tollerable pretext, or colour, be called a foundation of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Miſerable is the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111412:26"/> of theſe men, whoſe foundation is, either their own, or the act of ſome other man. But by the way, neither of theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are mine, nor can they by any regular conſequence or deduction, be infer'd from that diſcourſe of mine, to which the Collectour pretends in his margent. Howſoever, I preſume I have given a fair and ſatisfactory account, how, and how farre, and in what ſenſe, I both hold, and denie, as well the Engliſh Scriptures, as the Originals, to be the word of God.</p>
            <p>Concerning the power of the civill Magiſtrate, I have in my Epiſtle, before my late diſcourſe, intituled <hi>Hagiomaſtix</hi> diſplaied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not onely argued and aſſerted the lawfullneſſe of it, but the neceſſity alſo; yea and ſhewed the benefit and bleſſing of it unto the world; yea and further have endeavoured with all my might to convince the errour and ſin of thoſe, who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſubjection to it.</p>
            <p>I know nothing more, for matter of opinion, wherein I ſuffer from the world as an erroneous and unſound man, except it be concerning the eſtate and condition of the ſoul, between the time of death and the Reſurrection. My judgement herein hath been unduly repreſented from a Sermon of mine (the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ingagement whereof was to demonſtrate the immortality of the ſoul) as if I held, that the ſoul ſleeps untill the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whereas, as to this particular, I onely taught (with ſome little inlargement of my ſelf in the proof and proſecution of them.) 1. That the Scriptures very frequently repreſent the ſtate and condition of <hi>the perſon of a man,</hi> between the time of his death and reſurrection, by the <hi>metaphor,</hi> or ſimilitude of ſleep, and 2. That the Scriptures are very ſilent concerning the particular eſtate or imployments of the ſoul, during this ſpace: and that onely in the generall, they ſpeak them <hi>bleſſed</hi> (if the ſouls of thoſe who <hi>dye in the Lord,)</hi> If there be either errour of Hereſie, in either of theſe aſſertions; I ſhall upon convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either retract, or contentedly ſuffer, whether in name, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as an Erroneous or Hereticall perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, I have given thee a ſincere and cordiall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that with as much cleerneſſe and perſpicuity, as my intended brevity would admit, of what I hold in point of judgement, about thoſe Doctrines, or particular ſubjects in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111412:27"/> wherein the tongues of many have magnified themſelves ſo much againſt me, as a man holding rotten tenets, and in that reſpect, dangerous to be heard, dangerous to be converſed with. And as <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo much <hi>deſire a gift</hi> from the <hi>Philippians, as fruit that might abound to their account</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4. 17.</note>; ſo neither have I drawn up this brief vindication or explication of my ſelf in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters objected againſt me, ſo much to free my ſelf from the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, hard ſayings, and thoughts of men, as to free and deliver them from ſuch a courſe and practiſe, which I am certain will, without repentance, be matter of ſad <hi>account</hi> unto them in that day. For I am able, <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning me, to be abaſed</hi> in name and credit, as well as otherwiſe. Diſhonour, diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, defamations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the element wherein I have liv'd and my <hi>ſoul proſpered</hi> (through the goodneſſe of God) theſe many years. The yoke is little or no offence unto me, my neck having been ſo long accuſtomed to it. Yea I look upon my ſufferings <hi>for righteouſneſſe ſake</hi> (and ſufferings from men upon any other terms, I fear none) as the beſt earnings I can make of mortality. So that did I not conceive it as a duty lying upon me, or were it not otherwiſe a practice very ſutable to my ſpirit, to ſeek the everlaſting peace and comforts of men by every good way and means, and conſequently by removing, as far as I am able, every ſtumbling ſtone out of their way; I ſhould have been very faintly drawn into this ingagement of a vindication; my name being better able to bear the burden of my reproches, then my ſoul to want the benefit and bleſſing of them. <hi>Bleſſed are ye, when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evill againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven: for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets that were before you</hi> Matth. 5. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe of this preſent diſcourſe, I ſhall make a brief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the ſubſtance or heads of thoſe Demonſtrations, by the full explication and diſcuſſion wherof of late, in the ſtanding courſe of my Miniſtry, I fully, and (as I ſuppoſe) above all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, evinced the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, their Parentage and deſcent from God.</p>
            <p>The arguments or demonſtrations, by which I aſſerted that Bleſſed concluſion we ſpeak of, were firſt, and in the generall,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111412:27"/> divided into two kindes. The firſt, we called, <hi>Intrinſecall;</hi> the later, <hi>Extrinſecall.</hi> By the former, we meant ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or arguments, which are found in, or (as it were) inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in, the body of the Scriptures themſelves. By the later, ſuch, which, though found out of the Scriptures, yet have a potent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie and import to advance the ſame Truth with the former, in the judgements and conſciences of men. Thoſe which we called Intrinſecall, we ſubdivided; 1. Into ſuch, which reſpect the penning, phraſe, language, and manner of indighting, or frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures. 2. Into ſuch, which reſpect the matter, or ſubſtance of them: both which kindes of argument we looked upon, as ſo many divine characters printed and ſtamped (as it were) upon the body or face of the Scriptures, bewraying their Originall and deſcent from God. The later ſort of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we called <hi>Extrinſecall,</hi> we likewiſe ſubdivided, 1. Into ſuch remarkeable paſſages or acts of Divine Providence, whereby God plainly own's the Scriptures as his, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 2. Into ſuch either doings, or ſayings of men, which are ſo far confederate with thoſe Providences of God, as to joyn in teſtimonie with them on the behalf of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The Arguments drawn from the penning, phraſe, frame, and manner of inditing the Scriptures (which were the firſt kinde of thoſe we called <hi>Intrinſecall)</hi> were theſe following (in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, eight.)</p>
            <p>Firſt, The nature, qualitie, and manner of the ſtile or phraſe, wherein the Scriptures are written, being ſo emphatically and ſignall, different from the tenour of all humane writings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that have yet come to light in the world, give a clear and pregnant teſtimony unto them, that they come from God. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> atteſteth this teſtimony, withall aſſigning the ground or reaſon of ſuch a difference, when he ſaith; <hi>which things</hi> (ſpeaking of the matter or ſubſtance of things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures, and particularly the Goſpel) <hi>we alſo ſpeak</hi> (1. utter, and publiſh unto the world, whether by writing, or word of mouch) <hi>not in the words, which mans wiſedome teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but which the holy Ghoſt reacheth comparing</hi> [or rather, ſuiting, or fitting, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, adaptantes, or, coaptantes] <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals with ſpirituals</hi> (for ſo it is in the originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 13.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:111412:28"/> 1. matter, or things which for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſubſtance are <hi>spirituall,</hi> with words and phraſes which are <hi>ſpirituall</hi> alſo, and ſo ſuitable to them. It is (I confeſſe) very difficult and hard, or rather indeed unpoſſible, for a man fully to explicate the differences between the Scripture phraſe and expreſſion, and the language and phraſe uſed in other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But as the palate or ſenſe of taſting in men, clearly taſts and diſcerns the difference of taſts between meats and meats, of which difference notwithſtanding (at leaſt in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) they are not able to give an account in words: in like manner the intellectuall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or principle of reliſhing in the ſoul, is capable of a diſcerning and diſtinguiſhing ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between words and words, expreſſion and expreſſion, which the tongue of a mans underſtanding is not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the apprehenſion of another. And as the fruit of the vine, the grape, is eaſie to be diſcerned from the fruit of the thorn; and the fruit of the figtree, from any thing that comes from the thiſtle; ſo in reaſon, thoſe words, that ſtile, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, which are extraordinarily and in reference to a very particular and ſpeciall occaſion, taught by that great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the holy Ghoſt, muſt needs be conceived, as eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, from the beſt and moſt refined phraſe or ſtile that can proceed from the wiſedome of men. The difference we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and opened ſo far, as to render intelligent men fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and apprehenſive of ſome particularities in it: but we judge the diſcourſe too long to be here inſerted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſpirituality, the admirable workmanſhip, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing upon a narrow and cloſe inſpection, in the joints of the Scriptures, I mean in the connexions and dependencies, which one paſſage hath with, and upon another; and one ſentence and period, upon another; leadeth us beyond all that is called <hi>man,</hi> to finde the Authour and workman of them. There is no ſuch aſpect between the conjoin'd ſentences in other Authours or writings, which is in this. It is ſomewhat hard to expreſſe this difference alſo (as was ſaid in the former point) to weak ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; eſpecially to ſuch, as are not in ſome good meaſure acquainted with other writers, and have not taken knowledge, how, or after what manner their ſayings and ſentences hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111412:28"/> another. The Apoſtle himſelf was at a like loſſe upon a like occaſion or concurrence of circumſtances; I mean, how well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelf in matters of a ſpirituall, and ſomewhat unuſuall importance, to capacities unacquainted with ſuch things. <hi>Of whom</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt) we have many things to ſay, and hard to be uttered;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> hard to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>i.</hi> backward and averſe from taking pains that you may be able to hear with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. But this by the way. To the point in hand I ſay, that there is no ſuch contexture or complication of ſentences in other writings, as thoſe that are found from place to place in the Scriptures; I mean of ſuch an exquiſite, cloſe, and profound contrivance; or which ſtrike and affect the apprehenſions and underſtandings of men with that ſtrength and delight of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, when they are cleerly ſeen and apprehended. As there is a great difference or variety in the skill and play of wraſtlers, ſome cloſe with, and faſten upon their adverſaries one way, take hold of one limb, and ſome on another: So the ſayings and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scriptures take hold of their fellows, and faſten one upon another by an art or method peculiar to themſelves, and which other writings know not. Look what manner of difference may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have been between the workmanſhip of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiah,</hi> whom God <hi>fill'd with the Spirit of God, in wiſedom, and in underſtanding, and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in all manner of workmanſhip to deviſe cunning works, to work in gold, and in ſilver, and in braſſe in ſtones, and in timber</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 31. 3, 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, (as the Scripture ſpeaks) and between the workmanſhip of ordinary Artificers in the like materials; the like (yea, and farre greater) difference is obvious enough to be ſeen and apprehended, in the twining and twiſting together of ſentences by the finger of the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, and in thoſe which are wrought by the hand of humane wiſedom and art in other writings. Not but that theſe latter are (many times) rationall enough, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe diſcurſive principles, which are the excellency of man above other creatures; but they are nothing ſo ſpirituall, <hi>i.</hi> the reaſon which is in them, doth not require ſo much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111412:29"/> of things, ſo much contention and ſtreyning of the powers of the minde and underſtanding to come at it, not yet the knowledge of ſo many things beſides to reach and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, as that which lieth in the Scripture dependencies doth. Nor are they ſo comprehenſive of wiſedom as theſe: i. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or proportion of matter in them is nothing ſo great and large, as it is in theſe; they are nothing ſo laden with treaſure as theſe; yea they are light and empty (in compariſon:) You have many times great ſecrets, and much myſteriouſneſſe of wiſedom laid very cloſe, and artificially couch'd in the joints of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; whereas in other Authours there is no ſuch thing. It were eaſie to inſtance in particulars: but how then ſhould our deſigne of brevity ſtand?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another particular relating to the manner and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Scriptures, which alſo evinceth their royall deſcent with an high hand, is a certain Authoritativeneſſe, or God-like ſpeaking unto the creature from place to place: a ſhort, ſharp, and ſevere turning off of things and perſons; characters and forms of ſpeech not to be parallell'd in other Writers, and which cannot reaſonably be looked upon but as the prints or footſteps of a Divine Majeſty. Of this kinde of expreſſion is that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 9. repeated again <hi>ver. 43. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear:</hi> and again, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear:</hi> and elſewhere again and again: <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi> It is as a warning Peece from Heaven let off in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to awaken and rouſe the world out of their ſecurity, even Kings and Princes, and the greateſt Monarchs and Potentates of the earth, to attend with all their might and all their ſtrength to the great things of the Goſpel.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 7. 28, 29.</note> So the Scriptures teach the world with a majeſtick <hi>authority,</hi> which many times ſtrikes the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111412:29"/> hearts of men with fear and aſtoniſhment, and not like unto the writings of other men. And indeed ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch high charges and deep ingagements upon the world to hearken and to attend, as thoſe lately mentioned from the Scriptures, would be in other writings, but like <hi>new pieces put upon old garments</hi> (in our Saviours Parable) they would be ridiculous and importune, altogether unſutable to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſubjects handled in them. For let the tenour, weight, and importance of ſuch awakenings and addreſments unto the world, as this, <hi>Let him that hath ears to hear, hear,</hi> be but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered, and they will be found to hold a due and full proportion with things of the moſt glorious and tranſcendent importance, ſuch as is the ſubject matter handled in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: he that ſhall ingage the world to hearken and attend at ſuch a rate, as this Trumpet, <hi>Let him that hath ears to hear, hear,</hi> ſounds diſtinctly in his ears, had need have matters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting concernment and import to ſpeak unto the world; and ſuch (we know) he ſpeaketh, whoever he be that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, or out of, the Scriptures, unto the children of men. But the arguments and things handled and managed in other Authours, who pretend not to build upon the Scriptures, being but either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things appertaining to this preſent life, and ſo of inferiour conſequence; or if they pretend reference to another life, being but fabulous and irrationall, and not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the authours themſelves (as ſome of them have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) if the Authours ſhould ſummon in all the world to hearken upon terms of that deep and ſolemne ingagement, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do from place to place, they would render themſelves, and that which they have to ſay, but as ridiculous and weak to all knowing, and conſidering men. If a great King or Monarch ſhould ſend forth his Herauld at armes, or other Officer of ſtate, to ſummon in his Princes and nobles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality from all parts of his dominions, with delegates from all his ſubjects, to attend his pleaſure at his Court againſt ſuch a day; and having thus drawn them together, and rais'd their expectation concerning what he had to ſay, and impart unto them, ſhould onely diſcourſe to them of mint, aniſe, and cumin, or ſome ſuch inconſiderable ſubject, would not this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111412:30"/> render him very unfavourie, and contemptibly weak in the eyes of all men? whereas in this caſe, if he had had any thing to communicate unto them, which neerly concern'd the peace and and ſafety of the whole State and Kingdome, the ſolemnity of the preparations hereunto mentioned, had been comely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and no waies diſparaging. In like manner for God to amuſe, and alarm the world with the dreadfull ſound of ſuch a Trumpet as this, <hi>Let him that hath an ear to hear, hear,</hi> having the great things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of eternity to entertain their attentions and expectations with, when he hath thus rais'd them, is nothing but what becomes the wiſedome and goodneſſe of a God: but for men to make ſuch an <hi>O yes</hi> in the midſt of the world, having nothing to ſay to men, and to inform them of, but onely matters of light conſequence, as how to live a few daies on earth with ſome carnall contentment, or the like, would be of an apparant inconſiſtencie with all rules of reaſon and common underſtanding. And upon this ground it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that no man hath ever attempted to ingage the world at any ſuch rate.</p>
            <p>There is another vein of expreſſion in the Scriptures, which, by the ſharpneſſe and piercingneſſe of it, differing from any thing that is found in other writers, declares them to be a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by themſelves, and that fram'd by ſuch an Authour, who is God, and not man. Of this kinde are theſe ſayings: <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt still: and he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 22, 11.</note>. To which we may add that of the Apoſtle; <hi>If any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 13 43.</note>. And that of the Prophet: <hi>Ephraim is joyned unto Idols: let him alone</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Hoſ. 4 17.</note>. And that of our Saviour alſo: <hi>Let them alone: they are blinde leaders of the blinde</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note>. Theſe and ſuch like, are terrible and high ſayings, vialls full of the wrath and indignation of a God: ſayings, which as they are not fit for, ſo neither are they lightly to be found in the mouths or writings of men, who have not ſpake, or wrot, in the Name of God, and as from his mouth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſtrange compoſition, or conſtitution of the Scriptures, being made up of depths and ſhallows, of things near at hand, and things afarre of, of things myſterious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and things obvious and plain. That this is the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111412:30"/> and frame of the body of the Scriptures, needs little proof or clearing, it being nothing (I conceive) but what we all acknowledge, and that upon ſufficient evidence of Truth. There are ſome things in them, which the ſtrongeſt are not able to underſtand: and ſome things again, whereof the weakeſt cannot lightly be ignorant. God may be ſaid to dwell in the Scriptures themſelves, as in the Scriptures he is ſaid to dwell. Sometimes he is ſaid to dwell in light, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. and 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 7. Elſwhere he is ſaid to dwell in darkneſſe. <hi>The Lord ſaid he would dwell in the thick darkneſſe,</hi> 1 King. 8. 12. And <hi>Pſal 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 11. He hath made darkneſſe his ſecret place.</hi> So in ſome places and paſſages of Scripture, God comes forth, and ſhews himſelf in clear and perfect beauty unto the world, as in a viſion of the noon day: otherwhere he retires and hides himſelf behinde the dark clouds of obſcure and difficult expreſſions, where we may ſeek him long, and not be able to finde him; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews; <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me, and not finde me: and where I am can ye not come</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 7. 34.</note>. The minde of God in many places of the Scripture, hath been in ſeeking, and that by diligent and able Inquiſitours, now for many generations: and yet no man can ſay, ſo as to give any reaſonable account thereof unto others, if to himſelf, that he hath found it. <hi>There is a path</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) which no fowl hath known: neither hath the vultures or kites eye ſeen it</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Job 28 7.</note>. So there is a path of reaſon and underſtanding which leadeth to the diſcovery of God, and of the minde of God, even where it is moſt retired, and hid at the greateſt diſtance from the thoughts and apprehenſions of men. But (as the ſame Authour ſpeaks) <hi>it is</hi> (as yet) <hi>hid from the eyes of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and kept cloſe from the fowles of the aire</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note>. 1. Even from men that flie the higheſt pitch of reaſon, wiſedome and labour, to diſcover it. On the other hand, in many other places, God ſits (as it were) on the very ſuperficies and face of the letter; where even he that runs may diſcern him; he <hi>ſpeaks plainly</hi> unto men, and <hi>ſpeaketh no parable</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch a compoſition and frame of the Scriptures as this, the ingredients and parts whereof, being mountains and vallies, high things and low things, things obvious, and things inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, things earthly, and things heavenly (as our Saviour diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111412:31"/> them <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 3. 12.</note>) ſo exactly anſwer the temper, and modell of the univerſe, or great body of the creature, is a great argument, that one and the ſame workman was the Architect, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them both. If we look into the conſtitution and frame of the univerſe, we ſhall ſee the like checker-work (as we may call it) here, i. things of different, yea of oppoſite natures and properties, ſet (as it were) one againſt the other, yet all ſweetly, peaceably, and beautifully conſpiring to render this great Fabrique one entire piece, worthy the great workman that made it, and ſutable to his wiſedom. Here firſt we have the heavens, a lucid, ſhining, and active piece, eminent in ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and place: again we have the earth, a ſad, dark, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy element, anſwering the heavens by way of oppoſition, both in nature, propertie, and place. We have the element of fire, hot and dry, on the one hand: and the element of water, cold and moiſt, one the other. In the body of the earth, we have high mountains in one place, and vallies and plains in another: and again, hard rocks and ſtony grounds in one place, and ſoft and fruitfull ſoyle in another. In the ſea, we have flatts and ſhallows, as well as great depths; yea, in this element, we have as well ſmall, as great, and great, as well as ſmall, beaſts; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine Providence which <hi>David</hi> taketh notice of; <hi>Therein</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the Sea) <hi>are things creeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, both ſmall and great beaſts.</hi> The like compoſition we have on earth alſo: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gnatts as well as camels; flies, as well as Elephants or Lions. It were eaſie to inſtance in more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, in the frame of the univerſe, thus match'd and pair'd (as it were) by way of oppoſition and contrariety the one with the other.</p>
            <p>The like conſtitution is obſervable in the Providence of God, and tenour of his Adminiſtrations in the world. Theſe conſiſt likewiſe, of diſpoſitions, diſpenſations, paſſages and events, one anſwering another by way of oppoſition and contrariety. <hi>Conſider the work of God</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>for who can make that ſtrait, which he hath made crooked</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 13.</note>? implying, that God in his Providence (for he ſpeaks of his <hi>work</hi> in this) makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things <hi>crooked,</hi> i. croſſe, or contrary to mens deſires, as well as other things <hi>ſtraight, i.</hi> Commenſurable thereunto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111412:31"/> with them. <hi>Job</hi> gives another inſtance of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture in the ſame work. <hi>One</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dieth in his full strength, being in all eaſe and prosperity: his breſts are full of milk, and his bones runne full of marrow. And another dieth in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of his ſoul, and never eateth with pleaſure</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Job 21, 23, 24, &amp;c.</note>. And <hi>Solomon</hi> yet another: <hi>The rich and the poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 22. 2.</note>. <hi>i.</hi> in his providence diſpoſeth of riches and poverty, as he pleaſeth; and ſo is the maker both of all the rich and all the poor in the world, not materially only, as they are men, but formally alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> as they are either rich or poor.</p>
            <p>Again, If we look upon the naturall part of his Providence (as we may call it) here we ſhall ſee the ſame contexture and compoſition alſo. The naturall day (ſo called) is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of light and darkneſſe, according to the wiſe pleaſure of God in a regular tempering and diſpoſall of them. It is he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that <hi>makes both the ſummer and the winter</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> takes, and gives knowledge <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 74. 17.</note>) and the yeer is compounded of theſe. So he makes rain and fair weather, ſtorms and calmes, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixeth them, as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Now then inaſmuch as the ſtructure, frame, and conſtitution of the Scriptures, being ſuch as hath been declared, reſemble (as ye ſee) to the life, the reſpective tempers, conſtitutions, and complexions of thoſe other great pieces, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly, and without all controverſie God's, (I mean, the workmanſhip of his hands) the one anſwering the other, <hi>as face anſwereth face in the waters,</hi> they cannot in reaſon but be look'd upon as arguments of much conviction and ſtrength, to prove, that they alſo come from the hand of the ſame workman with the other.</p>
            <p>Beſides this correſpondency which the Scriptures hold with thoſe other great works of God we ſpake of, in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frame, which amounts (as hath been ſaid) to a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of much value, that the one is his, as well as the other, the Scriptures his, as well as the Creation or Government of the world, his; the compoſition we deſcribed, doth yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration and reſpect, plead their originall and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from God. Height of majeſty, and depth of condeſcention found in conjunction, make as perfect a character or lineament
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111412:32"/> of the face of God, as well can be imagined. <hi>Who is like unto the Lord God</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) who dwelleth on high</hi> (or, as the Originall, and your larger Bibles have it in the margent, <hi>who exalieth himſelf to dwell on high) who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 113. 5, 6.</note>; <hi>i</hi> condeſcendeth to interpoſe graciouſly, not only in the affairs of the Angels, who in the order and rank of creatures are high, and next unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, in honour and excellency of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to maintain and better their condition unto them, which notwithſtanding is a great condeſcenſion unto him; but alſo in the affairs of the pooreſt, and moſt contemptible, and weak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, who are farre beneath the Angels, to help, and comfort, and advance them (as appears in the following verſes.) Now this Interrogation, <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God?</hi> who being ſo high, looks ſo low, ſeems to imply, that this is a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition proper and peculiar unto God, and that there is little or nothing of it to be found amongſt thoſe that are <hi>exalted,</hi> and <hi>dwell on high</hi> upon the earth. They ſeldom or never <hi>humble themſelves</hi> to look beneath them; doe not intereſſe themſelves in the affairs of poor and mean men, to make their conditions better or more comfortable: no, they commonly behold the poore, as God doth <hi>the proud, a farre off:</hi> they deſpiſe them, and look upon their ſorrows, and troubles, and neceſſities, as impertinencies unto them. And as it is thus with men great in place and power in the world, in reſpect of thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them in both; ſo it is commonly alſo with men that are great in parts, learning and underſtanding, in reſpect of thoſe who are but low and weak in their abilities: they ſeldom <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> themſelves to treat with them, according to that which they are able to conceive, or underſtand, for their increaſe in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: if they can come up to their line of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and keep pace with them in their notions and expreſſions, they may receive benefit by them: but otherwiſe the men we ſpeak of, have no inclination to come down from the throne of their excellency, to miniſter to the neceſſities of weak and ignorant men. Thus then we ſee, how the very <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A fift particular, relating to the penning of the Scriptures, of like tendency and import with the former, is their Antiquity, eſpecially in thoſe parts of them, which bear the moſt ancient date, and were firſt laid as a foundatien of that intire fabrique, which hath ſince been raiſed, and built to it. The gray haires which are upon the head of the Scriptures, ſhew them to be the off-ſpring of the Ancient of daies. The writing we ſpeak of, hath the preeminency of all other writings in this point; it is the firſt-born amongſt all its brethren, I mean amongſt all other books and writings in the world; and may without boaſting compare with them all in the honour of ancientry, as the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am</hi>

It is true, the body of the Scriptures, as now it is compleated, is not in all the parts of it, ſo full of daies as we ſpeak of: there are many books and writings to be found that bear a farre more ancient date, then that part of the Scripture which we call the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; yea (poſſibly) then any the writings of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (though this be denied by <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Euſebius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but in their head quarters,) mean, in the books and writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein the ſumme and ſubſtance of all the reſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, they lye many years neerer the foundations of the world, and the building of the Sunns Tabernacle in the heavens, then all their fellows. <hi>That which was from the beginning</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> to thoſe unto whom he writes) <hi>do we declare unto you</hi>

This is more then any other writer in all the world can affirm, I do not ſay, with any ſufficient ground, but, with ſo much as any colourable ground of Truth, but only thoſe who draw from the fountains of the Scripture, what they declare in this kinde, and ſpeak the ſame things with them. The Goſpel, as touching the matter and ſubſtance of it, came from the mouth of God
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111412:33"/> himſelf unto our firſt parents, preſently upon the fall; which, according to the beſt computation, was within leſſe then a daies ſpace of their creation. It came infolded and wrapt up in that Oracle: <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head</hi>

This Argument drawn from the Antiquity, to evince the truth and goodneſſe of a Religion, is then very forcible, and little leſſe then demonſtrative indeed, when the Religion, which hath for a long time, from generation to generation, been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, profeſſed, and held up in the world, hath withall from time to time, from the firſt riſe and ſpring of the profeſſion of it, been ſtill oppoſed and perſecuted in the world; and the profeſſours of it, by this their profeſſion, rendred obnoxious to the hatred, malice, rage and fury of the world; if ſuch a thing as this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this Religion ſhall be ſtill loved, embrac'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd in the world; and live, and be like ſtill to live, and proſper in the midſt of the ſtormy and tempeſtuous proceedings of the world againſt it, though there be little hope of the ceaſing of theſe ſtorms for a long time; in ſuch a caſe (I ſay) as this, the Antiquity of a Religion, is a mighty confirmation of the truth, and revelation of it from God. The reaſon is, becauſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in it, to eat up it's Profeſſours, to expoſe them to troubles, ſorrows, afflictions from the world, hath alwaies been a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a kinde of prudentiall ingagement upon men, to inquire and ſearch ſo much the more narrowly into the eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it, and fully to ſatisfie themſelves whether it be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion worth the ſuffering for, or no, before they ſhould own in or ingage themſelves in the profeſſion of it, it being a moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall act, and unworthy of men, to ſell their precious comforts, peace, and accommodations in the world, for ſuch a thing, which they know not, whether it will benefit them in the leaſt, or no. And when men are to judge or give ſentence with relation to themſelves, in matters which ſo neerely concern them, in matters
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111412:35"/> appertaining to the fleſh, there is little fear they ſhould be brib'd by the ſpirit, but much that they ſhould be led away with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality on the fleſhes ſide. So that (doubtleſſe) did not men ſee ſomewhat like God, I mean ſomewhat that commands and overawes their conſciences in ſuch a Religion, which threatens their fleſh ſo ſoar, they would never have to doe with it upon any ſuch termes of danger, as thouſands have had to doe with the Religion contained in the Scriptures, thorowout all ages.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The longer any Religion hath continued or ſtood in the world upon the terms expreſſed, it hath taſted the ſpirits and judgements not only of ſo many the more men, but of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of men. Now as <hi>Solomon</hi> gives this reaſon, <hi>why two are better then one,</hi> viz. becauſe <hi>if one fall, his fellow will help him up;</hi> in like manner, when a matter or buſineſſe of ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſuch a Religion, as was mentioned, is, hath paſſed thorow the hands, not of one, nor of two, nor of a few, but of many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, it is not lightly poſſible, but that, in caſe one or two of theſe generations had had ſo little of men in them, as to look no better to themſelves, then to ſuffer their feet to be taken in ſuch ſnare, to go on with the profeſſion of ſuch a Religion, which threatned them with apparant loſſe in the world, and promiſed them nothing in compenſation thereof upon any hopefull or likely grounds, yet firſt or laſt, ſome one or other of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would have corrected the errour of thoſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and ſo have quite abandoned, and thrown that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion out of the world, which had ſo abuſed their forefathers.</p>
            <p>Now we know that the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of Chriſtian Religion (and conſequently of the Scriptures, wherein it is contained, and held forth) and Profeſſion thereof, hath that great advantage we ſpeak of in conjunction with it, to render it full of Authority, and excellent in power, to demonſtrate the goodneſſe and truth of this Religion, and conſequently the Relation which it bears unto God, as the Authour and Revealer of it. The Profeſſion hereof, ever ſince it was taken up in the world, from the daies of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> even untill now, hath expoſed the Profeſſours to all manner of ſorrows, troubles, and evil intreaties from the world. This the ſtories of all ages ſucceſſively from the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> unto the laſt ſufferer for it (whoever he is, or was)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111412:35"/> doe abundantly teſtifie: and (indeed) is nothing but what is generally granted on all hands. And yet we ſee, though it hath waded thorow ſo many deep waters, yea oceans of bloud; though it hath paſſed thorow ſo many fires, and the flames from time to time have kindled ſorely upon it, yea though there be yet more flames of fire, and ſeas of bloud before it in the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet it lives, and lifts up its head in the world, and hath thoſe in abundance, who are ready ſtill to ſuffer for it. Whereas all other Religions in the world, are but punies, and as of yeſterday, in compariſon of it: and beſides that Antiquity which they have, is not ſeconded with any ſuch collaterall advantage to make it argumentative, wherewith the Religion of Chriſtians, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpel and Doctrine of the Scriptures, is accompanied (as hath been ſhewed) and ſo hath little force in it to prove any truth or ſoundneſſe in them. It was a true obſervation of one, <hi>that the gods of the heathen were good fellows,</hi> and liked the company of one another well enough: it was only the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Jealous,</hi> and muſt be worſhipped alone. It was never ſaid (not yet verified by any experience) that whoſoever ſhould be ſtrict, or live conſcienciouſly, in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any other Religion, ſhould <hi>ſuffer perſecution;</hi> but that <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould ſuffer perſecution,</hi> is <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> by the Apoſtle <note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note>, and <hi>confirmed</hi> by the experience of all ages and places, when, and where any thorow-profeſſion of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and of the Scriptures, hath taken place.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly (to this) when the Antiquity of a Religion is ſuch, that it is able to calculate and prove the day of its nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in the world, to have had the precedencie in time, before all other Religions whatſoever, in this caſe the gray haires that are upon the head of it, doe fully evince it to be a way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, a religion that is from God. The reaſon is, becauſe as God had a being before Satan, ſo had he a worſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before him: nor is errour or falſhood in any kinde, any thing elſe, but a miſtake, or corruption of, or deviation from, the truth. Therefore that Religion which is moſt ancient, muſt needs be from God; and all ſubſequent Religions, ſo farre as they diſſent from that, or are contrary to it, are from ſome baſe Authour, and of a deluſive inſpiration. Now that the Religion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111412:36"/> comprehended in the Scriptures, was brought forth, and had a being in the world, when all other Religions were yet beneath in the earth, is (as hath been already argued and proved) the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſome of the greateſt Prophets and Patrons themſelves of all, or of moſt, and of the moſt conſiderable, of all other Religions.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, The manner of the bringing and coming in of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel into the world by the Scriptures, I mean in reſpect of the growth, or graduall diſcovery and manifeſtation of it, the body of the Scriptures ſtill waxing and increaſing with further light, unto the juſt compleature of them, which now they have attained, and wherein they reſt, and have reſted, theſe 1500. years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is another argument or conſideration effectually perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the deſcent and parentage both of the one and the other, from God. The Goſpel came not at once in the fullneſſe of the beauty, ſtrength and perfection of it into the world: in the firſt ſpring and dawning of it, it was a kind of brief and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Oracle, like the firſt dawning of the day, when there is a little mixture of light, with a greater quantity or proportion of darkneſſe in the air. It was no more but this; <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>; a ſaying which glimmered indeed with ſome light of good intended towards mankinde: but there was no diſtinct form or ſhape of that good, which was intended, nor of the means or Authour by whom it was to be effected. It was but like the corn, when it firſt ſprouts and peers above ground, which hath nothing that ſhape or body, which it comes to afterwards. Being thus in the bud and tender ſhoot of it, it was watered by thoſe precepts and directions which were graciouſly given by God unto <hi>Adam</hi> and his family, concerning ſuch a worſhip, and ſuch ſervices, as he required, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by his command for offring ſacrifices, together with his acceptation of theſe ſacrifices duly offered, ſome waies or other ſignified unto thoſe, who offered them. As oft as men offered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch terms as theſe, God accepted them; and ſo they had from time to time renewed acts of confirmation from God, that his heart was with them, and that he fully intended them good; and ſo were more and more eſtabliſhed in the love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God towards them. As a Charter, or act of Grace
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111412:36"/> from a Prince, whether to a Corporation, or perſon, the oftner it is renewed by him, affords the more ſecurity unto thoſe that are concern'd in it, of a full injoyment of all priviledges therein granted and intended.</p>
            <p>When the Goſpel had been in the world upon theſe terms, and under this firſt degree of diſcovery, about 1660. years, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the deſtruction of the world by the flood, God publiſheth a new edition of it unto <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, which was then the whole world of mankind. And though in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond edition, the Goſpel came forth in ſomewhat more plain and diſtinct words, (I mean, in words more eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) then in the former, yet the great particularities of the myſtery of it, wherein the glory and ſtrength of it conſiſt, and which were afterwards, though a long time after, brought forth into a cleer light, were not a whit more opened or diſcovered, then in that. The Goſpel, in this ſecond impreſſion we ſpeak of, was publiſhed, partly in the renewing of that Benediction and Charter, wherein the Lordſhip of the world had been by God conferr'd upon man in his creation <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 9. 2.</note>; partly alſo in certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning the continuance and ſtanding of the world, and that upon terms of Grace and comfort unto the inhabitants of it, for many generations <note n="b" place="margin">ver. 10, 11.</note>. Both theſe plainly ſhew, that God is in a reconciled poſture towards the world (and conſequently have ſomewhat of the Goſpel in them) as by a larger conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as well of the one, as of the other, we made to appear, when time was: but for the preſent we only recapitulate.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel, under this edition of it, continued in the world untill the daies of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the ſpace of more then 360. years. And now God was pleaſed to think of a new Edition of it, and (as it were) to dedicate it unto <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend. In this Edition, it came forth with ſome further light and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſome of the particularities of it, beyond what was to be found in either of the former; as <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of what family he ſhould come, that ſhould <hi>break the ſerpents head; In thy ſeed</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham) ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 22. 18.</note>. 2. Unto what the breaking of the Serpents head, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, doth amount unto, <hi>viz.</hi> the bleſſedneſſe of men. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> 3. Of what
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111412:37"/> extent the <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> which <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed ſhould bring upon the world, by <hi>breaking the ſerpents head,</hi> ſhould be, how farre it ſhould extend and reach: this is, to all the nations of the earth. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> 4. Here was a diſcovery made of that particular act or qualification in men, by which they are brought into part and fellowſhip, and come to partake of that bleſſedneſſe, which was brought unto the world by the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> Faith, or beleeving God, or, in God. <hi>And he</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham) beleeved God, and it was counted unto him for righteouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 15. 6.</note>. 5. In this Edition of the Goſpel, here was a picture, a lively portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or type of <hi>that ſeed of the woman,</hi> that ſhould doe this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſervice for the world, <hi>break the ſerpents head,</hi> both in reſpect of ſome perſonall properties or relations, as likewiſe of the means by which he ſhould doe it. Here was <hi>Iſaak,</hi> an <hi>only ſonne</hi> (as he is called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>viz.</hi> by a lawfull wife) and <hi>a belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſonne</hi> (in the ſame place) offered up in ſacrifice unto God, by his father. For ſo the Scripture ſpeaks: <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Iſaak; and he that had received the promiſes, offered up his only begotten Sonne</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11. 17.</note>. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>offered up</hi> his ſonne <hi>Iſaak,</hi> either becauſe he preſented him unto God upon the Altar, which was an <hi>offring</hi> of him <hi>up;</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he had fully purpoſed to have perfected the offering by his ſonnes death, had not God himſelf interpoſed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to reſtrain him. And as God <hi>accepts the will for the deed,</hi> ſo doth he uſually call the <hi>will,</hi> or ſetled purpoſe of doing, by the name of the deed. 6. And laſtly, He finiſhed this Edition of the Goſpel, by adding his <hi>ſeal</hi> for the confirmation of it, <hi>the ſigne of Circumciſion;</hi> which, according to the holy Ghoſts own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, was <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note>, <hi>i.</hi> a pledge, or confirmation, that whoſoever beleeved in God, ſhould be hereby juſtified, or made <hi>righteous,</hi> and conſequently be ſaved, and made everlaſtingly bleſſed.</p>
            <p>The world injoyed the Goſpel in this Edition of it, only with ſome typicall additions, as in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſcoveries from heaven relating unto it, now and then, to revive and quicken the remembrance of it in the hearts and mindes of men, as in the ladder which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111412:37"/> 
               <hi>reach'd from Earth to Heaven,</hi> and the Angel that wraſtled with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The world (I ſay) injoyed the Goſpel in that edition of it, which was publiſhed in the daies of <hi>Abraham</hi> untill the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the giving of the Law upon mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> which was about the ſpace of 430. years more. And now God made fourth edition of it, enlarging the former with a great multitude and varietie of typicall reſemblances, wherein all, or the greateſt part of thoſe myſterious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall particularities of it, were darkly ſhadowed, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitured out, as by the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſprinklings, and feaſts, and by Sacrifices eſpecially of many kinds, with a great variety of rites and obſervations accompanying them. This edition of the Goſpel, onely with ſome poſt-ſcripts of types and figures ever and anon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, as in the <hi>braſen Serpent, Manna, Joſhua, Sampſon, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Solomon,</hi> and ſome dawnings and glimerings of ſomewhat a clearer light ſhining from ſome of the Prophets, continved untill the daies of the promiſed <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> vntill he came in the fleſh, who was to doe that great charge and ſervice for the world, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>breaking the Serpents head</hi> to make the world whole. This was about the ſpace of 1517 yeeres more. Now he being <hi>the Lord from Heaven,</hi> and coming out of <hi>the boſom of the Father,</hi> where the Goſpel was form'd and faſhioned in all the parts and members of it, and had been (comparatively) <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>kept ſecret</hi> from the foundation of the world untill then, brought with him a perfect copie or extract of it, as a preſent from God his Father, ſent by his hand unto the world; which he in ſpeciall manner recommended unto his Apoſtles, to be by them publiſhed and preached thorowout the world, after that upon his Aſcention into Heaven, they had been <hi>endued with ſtrength from on High</hi> for that purpoſe, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghoſt in an extraordinary manner, both to be a remembrancer unto them of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>in the daies of his flaſh</hi> he had imparted unto them concerning the Goſpel <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 14. 26.</note>, as likewiſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the more myſterious ſence and meaning of many of theſe things <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 16. 13. 14.</note> Being now aſcended, and in full poſſeſſion of glory, to let his Servants and Saints in all generations know, that neither his love unto them, nor care for their good, were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111412:38"/> either ſwallowed up in his exaltation, or impaired in the leaſt by the Greatneſſe of his glory, he obtained from his Father the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Prophecie</hi> (as it is called <note n="c" place="margin">Revel. 1. 3.</note>) for them, which he imparted unto his Beloved Diſciple and Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> with a ſpeciall charge and order given him, to commit the ſame unto writing, that ſo it might be a light of conſolation unto his Saints, ſhining in the midſt of the darkneſſe of their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and ſufferings, to the worlds end. And with this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he hath taken his leave of his Churches, untill his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall returne againe unto them. So that this laſt and compleate edition of the Goſpel, containeth (beyond all the former, and with the raſure and diſ-authorization of many things conteined in them, in reference unto practice) thoſe paſſages of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctrine and Heavenly wiſdome, which the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf uttered on Earth in the daies of his fleſh, together with that Revelation which he gave down from Heaven, after his exaltation; as alſo thoſe Hiſtoricall and Doctrinall Informations and inſtructions, which are comprehended in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, together with thoſe two new ſeals, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the Supper of the Lord, for the confirmation of the Truth of things aſſerted in both. This edition being perfect, the world is to expect no more additions or poſt-ſcripts, to the end of it. Now if you pleaſe to compute the ſeverall ſpaces of time mentioned in this argument, and draw them together in one account or ſumme, allowing about 66 yeeres more, for the ſpace between the time that our Saviour preached the Goſpel on Earth, and gave unto <hi>John</hi> the Revelation menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, from Heaven (which is the complement, and as it were the laſt page of this new and laſt edition of the Goſpel) you will finde the whole diſtance or ſpace, from the firſt entrance of the Goſpel into the world, in that oracle we ſpake of, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> untill the laſt edit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of it completed, to amount to about 4043 yeares.</p>
            <p>Let us now breifly conſider, what there is in this graduall manifeſtation; and growth of the Goſpel, and of the Scriptures, for ſo great a ſpace of time as 4000 yeares and upward, before they came to perfection, to demonſtrate the pedegree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of them to be from God.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:111412:38"/>
            <p>We know it is Gods uſuall method in things ſublunarie, and endued with life, to raiſe and build them up to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective perfections, upon the ground worke and foundations of imperfection. The corne is brought forth out of the Earth by thoſe degrees, which our Saviour himſelf takes knowledge of: <hi>firſt the blade, then the car, and after this, the full corne in the care</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 4. 28.</note>. <hi>Paul</hi> was firſt <hi>a child,</hi> and all this while, <hi>ſpake as a child, thought as a child,</hi> did as a child: but afterwards, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, he <hi>became a man</hi> (as he ſaith) and <hi>then he put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way childiſh things</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 21.</note>. It is ſaid of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he <hi>increaſed in wiſdome and ſtature, and in favour with God and man.</hi> You will find it thus in plants, and trees, and <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 2. 52.</note> fruits, and all things that have life in them: they increaſe by degrees and grow to their maturitie and perfection, from much weakneſſe and imperfection at the firſt: and any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able growth or increaſe in what is good, is emphatically called, <hi>the increaſe of God: increaſeth with the increaſe of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of that <hi>increaſe,</hi> which the Church, or body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh in Knowledge, Faith, Holineſſe, and <hi>Love,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>knit together,</hi> and having nouriſhment miniſtred from the head, by the <hi>joints and bands</hi> in the body <note n="d" place="margin">Colo. 2. 19.</note>.) So then this hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been the expreſſe manner (as you have heard) method, and courſe, wherein the Goſpel hath advanc'd, and growen to that fullneſſe and height of perfection, whereat it now ſtands, doth it not carry a ſtrength of inducement in it, to conceive and judge, that it is a plant of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> planted by the hand of God himſelf, in as much as it doth ſo <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Nor can it reaſonably be objected to the prejudice of this argument, that Arts, and Sciences, and humane inventions in ſeverall kinds, have received additionall increaſes and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from time to time, as well as the Goſpel; being at this day (at leaſt moſt of them) raiſed to a line of perfection, farre above what they had obtained in their Infancies and youth. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though Arts and Sciences, and many artificiall inventions which had no greater founders, or Authors, then men (in the ſence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111412:39"/> we argue thorowout this whole diſcourſe) have in continuance of time, and ſucceſſively received their graduall advancements, and reſpective growths in ſtrength and beauty; yet this hath been with theſe 2 ſignall obſervations, and differences between them, and the Goſpel or Scriptures, Firſt, the men who have been Suceſſively imployed to raiſe and build up the body of the Scriptures, have onely built, and never pulled down: he that ſucceeded in the work, never contended with, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt his Predeceſſor, nor found the leaſt fault with his work-manſhip; whereas the Great Architects, and builders up of arts and ſciences, have ſtill fallen out one with another about their work; he that followed, blaming him that went before, as defective in his way, and inſufficient for his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; pretending (for the moſt part) to correct his errours, and attempting to overthrow, what he aſſerted. So that the increaſe and augmentation of Arts and Sciences, being purchaſed or procured, as well by the pulling downe of what either thorow negligence, or ignorance, had bin built amiſſe, as by the ſuperaddition of what was regular and found, carry an expreſſe character in them of the weakneſſe and inſufficiencie of thoſe, by whom they received them, and conſequently, of thoſe alſo who were the founders, and firſt fathers of them, whereas the increaſe of the Goſpel, and growth of the Scriptures, have ſtill advanced without the leaſt errour or ſhadow of miſcarriage in their way, thoſe who were ſet on work to make the former ſupplements or addition, being never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or corrected for any thing they wrote, but atteſted rather and commended, by thoſe who were ingaged in the latter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though Artes and Sciences and particular Inventions of men, have received growth and increaſe, ſince their reſpective births, or firſt ground-work laid in the world, yet is there none of them brought to any ſuch perfection, but they are ſtill capable of further augmentation and increaſe, yea there are new additions made unto them daily: yea there is little que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but that they will be ſtill growing and increaſing whilſt the world ſtands, and yet never come to their period of perfection; much like thoſe <hi>ſilly women</hi> whom the Apoſtle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,

Whereas the Scriptures and the Goſpel, have had the Seal of their conſumation and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them for theſe many generations; nor hath any man attempted, at leaſt with any ſucceſſe, or acceptation with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men, ſince the writing of the book of the Revelation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite or publiſh any thing by way of additament unto them, or as any further part, or member of them. This perfection, &amp; incapacity of any further inlargment from men, found in the Goſpel and Scriptures, atteſted and acknowledged by the whole world for theſe 1500. years &amp; upwards, is a pregnant inducement to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he is both the Authour and finiſher of them, who knowes how to accompliſh and perfect his works and undertakings at ſuch a rate, that neither the Wiſdome nor skill of any creature are able to make any addition unto them. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>that whatſoever God doeth, it ſhall be for ever: nothing can be put to it</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eccle. 3. 14.</note> &amp;c. Whereas that invincible imperfection, which is found in Arts and Sciences (invincible I mean, in reſpect of their ſtrength, who are, and have been, labouring and ſtriving from the firſt ages of the world to this day, to overcome it, but have not been able) is a great argument, that as well the Founders of them, as Benefactors, are but men.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There is in the Scriptures a mageſtique kinde of ſecurity, under many ſeeming (yea many ſeemingly bold, and venturous) contradictions, that yet neither the Honour of their Truth, nor that unitie which they have, in and with themſelves, ſhall at all ſuffer hereby. The conſideration hereof is of the ſame bleſſed confederecie with the former arguments, tending to cleare the pedegree of the Goſpel, and to demonſtrate the originall of the Scriptures to be from God. We ſhall not need to make any large collection of ſuch places or paſſages, whoſe faces ſeem to be ſet, and this ſometimes very ſiercely, the one againſt the other. I cannot but judge that of your ſelves you know many in this kinde. If we ſhould but narrowly examine the two Genealogies which the two Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> have drawn up in their Goſpels, to ſhew our Saviours pedegree and lineall deſcent according to the fleſh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, 1. Between themſelves, the one with the other. 2. Both
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111412:40"/> the one and the other of them with ſeverall places in the old Teſtament, we ſhall be furniſhed with inſtances in abundance of ſeeming (yea many ſtrongly ſeeming, ſeemingly irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable) contradictions. But for particulars in this kinde, I had rather (Reader) referre thee, to ſuch expoſitors and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the places, Who being diligent and judicious, as they have taken notice of theſe friendly (though enemy-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming) conteſts and oppoſitions between Scriptures and Scriptures, ſo have they interpoſed, and that with much feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of ſucceſſe, to compound them: amongſt whom, I ſhould abuſe an opportunitie of <hi>giving honour, to whom honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth,</hi> if I ſhould not recommend unto <hi>thee Fredericus Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius,</hi>

A little before my publique hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this theme concerning the Authority and originall of the Scriptures, I had occaſion in the courſe of my Miniſtry, to expound the Genealogy of <hi>Matthew;</hi> in which expoſition I ſalved the ſoares of thoſe ſeeming inconſiſtencies between the two Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and reconciled both the one and the other of them with the Old Teſtament in ſuch paſſages, wherein there was an appearance or face of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <note n="a" place="margin">Which was one reaſon why in laying down the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in hand to prove the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, I only inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of theſe ſeeming contradictions, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting their Solutions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo lately delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note>: in which atcheivement, I acknowledge my ſelf a debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the pen and paines of the ſaid Author.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to multiply inſtances of this kind, where Scripture ſeems to riſe up againſt Scripture, and ſaying againſt ſaying, and that not only in genealogicall computations, but even in matters of another nature, and which ſeem to be, yea and really are, of greater weight and moment; and yet one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be wrai's no manner of fear of hurting another, or of prejudicing the Honour or Truth of another.

It were eaſy to make this pile of ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties in the Scriptures much greater: but by theſe wherein inſtance hath been given, we may plainly diſcerne, that there is a greater eye of ſuch paſſages there, whoſe appearance is as <note n="e" place="margin">Philip. 4. 4.</note> if they affronted one the other, and were at open warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: Yea that is further conſiderable, that in all the inſtances given (as likewiſe it is, if not in all, yet in moſt of the reſt that might be given, being of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) the Scriptures, which carrie the ſtrongeſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being contrary to their fellowes, yet bewray no manner of tenderneſſe in this behalfe. They doe not ſtand to excuſe or purge themſelves, as if there were any cauſe at all to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them for any croſſeneſſe or contrariety unto others; no, they ſpeak from place to place, what they have a minde to ſay, with that liberty and freedome, as if there were nothing ſaid by them elſewhere, that either was like to ſuffer the leaſt prejudice by it, or elſe to caſt the leaſt prejudice on it.</p>
            <p>Now then, Let us conſider a little, whither there be not in the conſideration held forth unto you, that which bewrayes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then humane in the Scriptures. Of all writings under Heaven, they aſſume moſt unto themſelves, as that they are <hi>the words of eternall Life</hi> that they are <hi>inſpired by God,</hi> that they are the <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>faithfull witneſſe, that they ſhall judge the world,</hi> that they are <hi>that immortall ſeed of which the ſons and daughters of God muſt be begotten,</hi> &amp;c. And yet they ſpeak and utter themſelves from place to place, as if they cared not to deſtroy that Intereſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111412:41"/> credit, and belief, which in ſome places they labour to procure for themſelves, in the hearts and conſciences of men. For that which in one place they build up in another they ſeeme to pull down; that which in one place they affirme, in another they ſeem to deny: what in one place they injoyn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to be done, in another they ſeem to prohibit, and to reſtraine from doing. Some of them ſeem to lye to the North, and ſome to the South: ſome to the Eaſt, and ſome to the weſt; and to conflict, combate and contend amongſt themſelves, as <hi>the four windes of the Heavens</hi> did in <hi>Daniels</hi> viſion; <hi>upon the Sea</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 7 2.</note>. And yet for all this, they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world, God, Angels, and men, like <hi>Princes</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak's) undaunted, untroubled, un-appald, as full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to proſper in their way, and carry the world before them, to gaine upon the hearts, and ſouls, and conſciences of men, as if they knew nothing by themſelves, were conſcious of nothing in themſelves, that were like to hinder them. So then this is that which I ſay, that ſuch a Security and majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que confidence, as the Scriptures every and a non bewray of doing great matters, of turning the world (as it were) upſide downe, of being had in reverence and high eſteem with men, upon ſuch terms of diſadvantage, and reaſons to feare the contrary (as fleſh and blood might reaſonably judge) is a ſigne that their confidence is divine, &amp; that their ſecurity in ſuch a caſe, is the ſecurity of God; eſpecially conſidering that this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <hi>makes them not aſhamed;</hi> but is juſtified from Heaven daily by ſucceſſe anſwerable to it. If they did not know, that God both could &amp; would, give guifts of reaſon, wiſdome, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto men whereby to throw downe the mountains, and to fill up the valleys that are in them, and to make the rough things plaine, to make a clear peace between things that ſeeme to be at variance, yea and that he would ſtirre up their hearts, to ingage themſelves, and improve theſe abilities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; at leaſt if they had not known, that men would ſo far reverence thoſe beames of light, thoſe glorious Truths, which clearly ſhine in them, as for their ſakes to reverence the hidden things of darkneſſe, which are there, and the things which they cannot underſtand, ſo far at leaſt, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111412:41"/> the things that are cleere, becauſe of the things that are obſcure; if (I ſay) the Scriptures had not known and fore-ſeen theſe things, they would (doubtleſſe) have been as tender of their own intereſt in this kinde, as provident for themſelves and their own honour, as men uſe to be in their writings. Men that write and make books upon their own intereſt becauſe they know not, in caſe they ſhould write as knottily as the Scriptures are written (in many places) and let ſuch ſentences or ſayings paſſe from their pen from place to place, which would trouble men as much, ingage men as deep, to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencie of ſence between them, as the Scriptures frequently doe; becauſe they know not (I ſay) whether men would ever be at this coſt and charge with their writings, or no, or caſt any ſuch honour upon them, to make their darkneſſe, light; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are very tender, cautious, and circumſpect (eſpecially thoſe that are the wiſeſt, and moſt conſiderable amongſt them) not to expoſe themſelves ſo much as to the leaſt ſuſpicion of writing contradictions, of being inconſiſtent with themſelves. And when they have any occaſion to ſay or expreſſe any thing, which carrieth an appearance in it of ſome contrariety to what they affirm elſewhere, they ſtill give notice of it in one kinde or other, and are carefull to diſtinguiſh, and to explain themſelves with much anxiety and warineſſe, as being timorous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that otherwiſe they ſhould ſuffer loſſe in the opinions and eſteem of men. Whereas the Scriptures on the contrary, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places ſeem to ſpeak, as if they cared not either to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or beleeved: and yet otherwiſe expreſſe as great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of both, as if they knew nothing by themſelves (as was ſaid) why they ſhould diſtruſt or queſtion either. When they come to aſſert or deliver any thing afterwards, which ſeems to trench upon ſomething which they had formerly ſaid, they are ſo farre from giving any notice or warning of ſuch a thing, or from diſtinguiſhing themſelves into a cleerneſſe of conſiſtence with themſelves, to prevent a miſapprehenſion in this kinde in the thoughts of men, that very frequently they expreſſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in the ſame word or terme wherein the affirmative was expreſſed before, and on the contrary; as it were on purpoſe to raiſe and ſtrengthen the ſeemingneſſe of the contradiction.

            <p>Thus then we ſee what there is in the conſideration in hand, to plead the Originall and deſcent of the Scriptures from God, and to difference them from all the writings of men, I mean ſuch as have been written by men, without the inſpiration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe guidance of the holy Ghoſt.

            <p>Nor doth he only freely and plainly relate things tending to his own diſparagement, but upon the ſame occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> when the glory of God, and the after-information of the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, he knows neither brother, nor ſiſter, nor the greateſt, or moſt honourable of all his fore-fathers, but unpartially ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth their reputations and honours alſo upon the ſervice of the comfort and caution of the world, declaring in open and free hiſtory, how farre they acted from time to time beneath their excellency, being Saints and ſervants of the moſt high God.

If all that which is truly excellent and deſireable in all the ſpirits or diſpoſitions of all humane writers whatſoever, could be extracted from all their writings together, and made up into one and the ſame conſiſtence; there might from the writings, either of <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, or of <hi>Paul</hi> alone, be drawn forth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or quinteſſence, incomparably more celeſtiall and divine, then it.</p>
            <p>We might here have preſented you with another conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:111412:44"/> or argument (reducible to that head of diſcourſe, from which we have argued hitherto) for the further eviction of that great concluſion, which we deſire to bring forth into a cleer and perfect light, the Divine Authority of the Scriptures; <hi>viz.</hi> the admirable harmony and conſent, for ſubſtance and truth of matter, which is found betwixt their reſpective pen-men and parts, from the firſt, to the laſt of them. They march like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in good array, where every man keepeth his rank, and none thruſteth, or troubleth his fellow. But becauſe this is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration more frequently inſiſted upon, and opened, by others; and hath been already taken notice of (in part) by us, in a former Argument, we ſhall, for the preſent, wave the further plea of it.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed thoſe arguments and conſiderations of the firſt ſort, drawn from the manner of the Scriptures, in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and frame, and which tend with an high hand to ſecure the world, that they are indeed royally deſcended, and know no Father, or Authour, either amongſt men or Angels, whether good, or bad, but God only; let us in the next place advance ſuch arguments and demonſtrations, for our further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſame truth, which ariſe from their matter; I mean from the nature, property, and import, of the things themſelves delivered, and held forth in them.

The penetrating or ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature and property of the Scriptures; I mean into the hearts and ſpirit and conſciences of men, <hi>to ſeparate the vile from the precious,</hi> and to diſcover the hidden things of the greateſt darkneſſe there. 5. The mighty efficacy and power they have, by the things which they teach, to inlarge, raiſe, and lift up the hearts of men, that are fallen, and ſunk, and dead within them. 6.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:111412:44"/> they have, I mean to change and alter the natures and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tempers of men; to turn both the hearts and waies of men upſide down. 8. That excellency of wiſedom, thoſe heights and depths of underſtanding, which are diſcovered in that great tranſaction of the Goſpel, as it is preſented unto the world in the Scriptures. 9. The great and wonderfull myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe of this evangelicall tranſaction. 10. And laſtly, The glorious and moſt tranſcendent importance of this tranſaction, by way of benefit and bleſſing upon the world; all theſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a joint conſideration, doe, againſt, and above all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and fear, evince the Scriptures to be from God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That excellent ſpirit of holineſſe, which breaths in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">The firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> of the ſouls and conſciences of men, out of many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, motives, examples, and other expreſſions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is a fair lineament in the face of God, and plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies his intereſt and hand in the framing of them.</p>
            <p>Let me 1. (in a word) ſhew you what I mean by that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which the Scriptures ſo ardently deſire to advance and propagate in the world. 2. I ſhall (with like brevity) acquaint you, how glorious and fearfull the Scriptures are in preſſing and perſwading unto holineſſe. 3. and laſtly, We will ponder the conſideration hereof a little, and ſee what it contributes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our important deſigne.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Holineſſe, in the ſence we now ſpeak of it (for there are ſeverall ſignifications of the word) may be deſcribed after ſome ſuch manner as this: It is an honourable impreſſion, property, or quality in the rationall nature or being, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the ſubject to an abſolute and utter ſeparation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency in affection, from whatſoever is ſinfull, as ſuch; (I mean, ſo farre as it is ſinfull.) And ſuch waies and actions which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſuch a principle as this, may be called <hi>Holy.</hi> We ſhall not now ſtand to examine or ſcan the deſcription, it being not ſo proper to the buſineſſe in hand. Holineſſe in God, ſeems to be that nature, attribute or property in him, which inclines him to move and act in all his wayes and diſpenſations, at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt elongation and diſtance that can be imagined, from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe whatſoever. In men and Angels, it imports ſuch a principle, which inclines them to an abſolute conformity with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111412:45"/> God, in his waies and actions. That paſſage of the Pſalme (with many others, where we finde righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction) <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 145. 17.</note>, gives ſome teſtimony to the truth and propriety of the deſcription. We ſhall not (for the preſent) lead you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the way by following it, or by any narrow inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the nature or property of holineſſe, or how it differs from other graces. It is ſufficient, as to the point in hand, to know, that the holineſſe, which the Scriptures ſtrive with ſo much importunity to ingage the world unto (as we ſhall ſee preſently) is a conformity or likeneſſe unto God in that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute or perfection of his nature, which inclines him to doe all things that he doth, like unto himſelf, like unto a God, that is, not only after the moſt exact and abſolute manner in all points, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the omiſſion or neglect of the leaſt, or leaſt conſiderable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that might adde beauty and perfection to it, but all this alſo with the greateſt alienation of minde and affection from doing otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The next thing is to demonſtrate and ſhew unto you, how, and at what rate the Scriptures groan, and travail (as it were) in pain, with the unholineſſe, looſneſſe, and prophaneſſe of the world: and how mightily they advance and lift up themſelves, to advance holineſſe amongſt the ſons and daughters of men; to transform the hearts and waies of men into the ſimilitude and likeneſſe of that glorious attribute of holineſſe, which is in God, and in all his waies.</p>
            <p>There are three geat Engins eſpecially (if we may ſo call them) which the Scriptures uſe, and by which they drive on this great and bleſſed deſigne of promoting holineſſe in the world. The firſt, is made of precepts and commands: the ſecond, of motives or arguments of perſwaſion: the third and laſt, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. It is true, all the three in ſtrictneſſe of ſpeaking, and in a generall conſideration, may be reduced to that one mentioned in the ſecond place. Commands of holineſſe from God, and ſo examples of holineſſe, both from God and men, have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of motives unto holines: but by diſtinguiſhing them, we both provide the better for method and memory, and likewiſe follow the example of the holy Ghoſt himſelf, who ſtill differenceth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:111412:45"/> the precept from the motive, by which it is preſſed, and bound fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and cloſer to the hearts and conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt ſee how inſtant the Scriptures are upon the world with precepts and commands for holineſſe. <hi>For I am the Lord your God</hi> (ſaith he that ſpeaketh out of them unto the world) <hi>ye ſhall therefore ſanctifie your ſelves, and ye ſhall be holy, for I am holy.</hi> And again, <hi>for I am the Lord which bringeth you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye ſhall therefore be holy, for I am holy</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 11. 44, 45.</note>: Injunctions expreſſed in the future tenſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative mood <hi>[ye ſhall be holy, &amp;c.]</hi> are moſt emphaticall and authoritative; importing, not ſimply the will or deſire of the commander; nor ſimply the duty of the commanded; but alſo the peremptorineſſe of the one, and the imminent danger of the other, if neglected. If we ſhould tranſcribe, and argue, theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing paſſages, <hi>Lev. 19. 2. Lev. 20. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 15, 16. Heb. 12. 14. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Matth. 5. 48.</hi> with many others of like conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and import (which we leave to your private obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) you would cleerly ſee how ſtrong and ſoar the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are in their injunctions and commands for holineſſe, upon the world. So that if the authority and intereſt of him, who ſeeks to order and umpire the world by the Scriptures, can doe any thing, men and women ſhall not be prophane, or unclean, but <hi>holy:</hi> theſe are at work with all their might, and with all their power, to make all holy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take we into conſideration alſo, with what poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, height, and variety of motive, and argument of perſwaſion, the Scriptures bow and bend themſelves, yea turn themſelves this way and that, and every way that lightly can be thought of, to commend the grace and exerciſe of <hi>holineſſe</hi> unto men; to intereſſe the hearts and affections of men and women, in the love, deſire, and ſtudy of it. There are ſcarce any of the commands lately pointed unto, which call for <hi>holineſſe,</hi> but are attended and guarded with their motives and incitements proper to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture preſſeth and perſwades unto <hi>holineſſe,</hi> by this conſideration, that <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>is holy. Be ye holy, for I am holy</hi> (ſaith he that ſpeaketh in the Scriptures, as we heard before from <hi>Moſes.)</hi> Now ſuppoſing (for the preſent, being yet but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111412:46"/> upon the proof of it) that it is God himſelf who thus ſpeaketh, of how ſoveraign an influence muſt this conſideration, that <hi>God is holy,</hi> needs be upon the hearts and ſouls of men capable of it, to perſwade unto holineſſe? What! a mortall man, who is by nature but duſt and aſhes, and by miſcarriage, a thouſand degrees more imbaſed then ſo, to be like unto God? to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in ſo darling an Attribute as his <hi>holineſſe?</hi> What? he that was deſcended ſo low, to aſcend thus high? The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves, when they ſtudied and ſet themſelves, to ſpeak at the higheſt rate they knew how, in way of honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, whether of perſons, or of actions, they uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves, by affirming the one to be like unto God, and the other to render men like unto God. Their great Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he had in an Oration drawn the portraicture of the Emperour <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as he intended, by the repreſentation of a man performing ſuch and ſuch things highly vertuous and rare, cloſeth his ſentence after this manner; <hi>He that ſhall doe ſuch things as theſe, I think him not to be a man, but judge him to be</hi>

               </gap>, i. <hi>to be a generall benefactour, and to doe good unto many, is to become like unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture perſwades and preſſeth unto <hi>holineſſe</hi> upon this ground; <hi>viz.</hi> that men and women are brought into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being <hi>holy,</hi> by ſo high an hand of grace and vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, as the death of his only begotten Son. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having injoyned Chriſtians to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation, even as he that had called them was holy,</hi> and to <hi>paſſe the time of their ſojourning here in fear</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note>; immediatly he ſubjoyns this by way of motive, or ingagement; <hi>Foraſmuch as ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation received by tradition from your Father; but by the precious bloud of Christ, as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot</hi> &amp;c. <note n="b" place="margin">verſ. 8.</note> This alſo is a motive of wonderfull impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and power, where it is thorowly reſented, and takes kindly upon the ſpirit, to perſwade unto <hi>holineſſe.</hi> It ſuppoſeth 1. that it is a priviledge, yea a great prerogative, for men that had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111412:46"/> been in ſuch a condition of bondage and ſlavery under ſin, as they had been, to be ſo farre brought off from thoſe terms of ſhame and miſery, as (if they be willing to enter in by it) to have ſuch an effectuall door open unto them, whereby to paſſe into the glorious liberty of <hi>holineſſe.</hi> The Angels that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, have no part or followſhip in ſuch a priviledge as this: the iron gate of the irreverſible decree of God is faſt ſhut upon them: they are in no capacity of coming forth out of their dungeon of ſin and miſery, into the light and bleſſedneſſe of <hi>holineſſe.</hi> And 2. it aſſerteth, that this priviledge, or capacity for them to become <hi>holy,</hi> was not procured or bought, nor procurable, or to be bought, for them, by ſuch mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things, as ſilver and gold, for which yet we know things of greateſt worth and conſequence in matters appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this life, may be had, but <hi>by the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that the greatneſſe of the price, by which a priviledge, liberty, or commodity in any kinde is purchaſed for a man, (eſpecially by thoſe, who are of wiſedom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſufficient not to over-purchaſe, not to <hi>give</hi> their <hi>ſilver for that which is not bread)</hi> is a proportionable ingagement upon the man, for whom this purchaſe is made, to improve this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the uttermoſt, as well for his benefit and advantage who hath made the purchaſe for him, as for his own. The price that hath been given to put the world into a capacity of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> being no leſſe, then <hi>the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that only ſacred treaſure, which either heaven or earth could afford, or furniſh the Almighty with, for ſuch a purchaſe, duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is an aſtoniſhing weight of ingagement upon the world, to be <hi>holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures call upon the world for <hi>holineſſe,</hi> by the great voice of this conſideration; that God, when he was free, hath yet made himſelf a mighty debtour, a debtour of infinite ſummes of treaſure, unto the world, eſpecially by thoſe great and precious promiſes which he hath given unto it, concerning the life, and glory, and great things of the world to come, the everlaſting injoyment and fruition of himſelf, and that upon the moſt deſireable terms, that it is poſſible for a creature to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him; <hi>viz.</hi> ſo, as that he will become <hi>all in all</hi> unto it; that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111412:47"/> is, not communicate himſelf by any means or mediation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, or joyn any creature whatſoever with himſelf, to make the bleſſedneſſe of him that ſhall injoy him, a compounded bleſſedneſſe, conſiſting partly of the benefit received from a creature, partly of what is derived unto it by the creatour; but will fill the whole capacity of him that ſhall enjoy him, with nothing but himſelf; ſo that his bleſſedneſſe ſhall have no ingredient at all in it to allay or qualifie it but it ſhall be wholly, purely, and entirely <hi>God, all God;</hi> who as he contains all things whatſoever, <hi>per modum eminentiae,</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak) by way of eminency, in his eſſence or in himſelf, Angels, men, joy, ſtrength, life, peace, glory, and whatſoever is named not in this world only but in that alſo which is to come; ſo will he be this <hi>all things,</hi> after a farre more excellent, after a farre more incomparably excellent manner, to thoſe that ſhall injoy him, then the things themſelves would be, if they were injoyed by him. This is the laſt and moſt compleat eſtate and condition of bleſſedneſſe, whereunto the creature ſhall be brought; and wherein, being once entred and brought into it, he ſhall abide for eternity. But before his coming or bringing hither, he ſhall paſſe thorow the accompliſhment and ſweet enjoyment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other the great and precious promiſes of God, as of being rais'd again from the dead, of having his vile body made like unto the glorious body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of living and reigning with <hi>Chriſt</hi> a thouſand years, with many other of like glorious and bleſſed importance; all which notwithſtanding ſhall at laſt run into that immenſe Ocean of bleſſedneſſe and glory which we ſpeak of, and there be ſwallowed up, and loſe themſelvs and their names, as the faireſt and goodlieſt rivers doe, when once they are fallen into the main ſea. But this by the way. But that the Scriptures doe (as it were) adjure the world unto <hi>holineſſe,</hi> by the <hi>great and precious promiſes</hi> which God hath made, and wherein he ſtands ingaged unto the ſons and daughters of men, is evident by that place formerly cited, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire theſe promiſes</hi> (dearly beloved) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Cor. 7. 1.</note>; implying, that, however <hi>holineſſe</hi> (eſpecially in any conſiderable eminencie or <hi>perfection)</hi> carries a ſtrong antipathy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111412:47"/> in it, to the corrupt natures and vile diſpoſitions of men; yet they who have ſuch an advantage over their hearts, ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make their corrupt natures turn head upon their vileneſſe and corruption, as the glorious <hi>promiſes</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel afford, ought in reaſon, and well may (by the improvement of the means before them) raiſe, and work up themſelves to an eminent degree and pitch of <hi>holineſſe:</hi> Yea this improvement of the promiſes we ſpeak of by men, I mean to an excellencie of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> ſeems to be one of the main ends or intents, on Gods part, why they were given. <hi>Whereby</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the divine nature,</hi> &amp;c. It is the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the <hi>exceeding greatneſſe, and preciouſneſſe</hi> of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſes, which makes them a proportionable and apt means to communicate or impart the <hi>Divine nature (holineſſe)</hi> unto men. If a King ſhould deſire to raiſe a noble and princelike ſpirit, in a perſon of low and ordinary birth and breeding, his onely way were to adopt him for his ſon, and to declare him his ſucceſſour in his Throne. When <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed by the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to be King over Iſrael, it is ſaid that as he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to go from <hi>Samuel, God gave him another heart,</hi> i. an heart thoughtfull and conſiderative, how to rule, and act the part of a King; whereas the heart he had before, was but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd to the occaſions and intereſts of a private man. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this rais'd and princelike heart was not <hi>given</hi> unto <hi>Saul</hi> by any miraculous or ſupernaturall inſpiration, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from God, but by an ordinary concurrence in the minde and ſpirit of <hi>Saul</hi> with that great providence of his towards him, in calling and anointing him to be a King. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof ſtriking effectually upon <hi>Sauls</hi> heart, being now diſcharged from his attendance upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſo more free to take the impreſſion of this great occurrence home, it ſeems quite altered the frame and conſtitution of it, and made it Regall. The promiſes of the Goſpel thoroughly underſtood, conſidered and beleeved, cannot but <hi>fulfill the joy</hi> of him that gave them, in making his creature like unto himſelf, <hi>holy,</hi> as he is <hi>holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scriptures are ſo impatient of being denied what they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111412:48"/> call for in this kinde (I mean in point of holineſſe) from the world, ſo unable to bear the world in an averſeneſſe hereunto, that they threaten the loſſe of the ſight and face of God, and therein, of all joy, and peace, and comfort for evermore, and conſequently the vengance of eternall fire, to all thoſe that are prophane, or <hi>unhold. Follow peace with all men</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> in a place formerly cited) and <hi>holineſſe: without which,</hi> i. without which <hi>holineſſe</hi> not, without which <hi>peace</hi> (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Article in the Greek, which being of the maſculine gender, agree's with <gap reason="foreign">

This motive is in the hand of the Scripture as a rod of iron, to batter and break in pieces, all that ſtubborneſſe and contradiction, which is in the natures and hearts of men againſt <hi>holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeverall other motives, by the meditation whereof the Scripture is wont to urge and preſſe hard upon the world for <hi>holineſſe;</hi> as ſometimes, the conſideration of the beauty of it; otherwhile, it holds forth the glory of it, yea, it oft calls it by the name of glory <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor 3. 18. Eph 5. 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>; again, ſometimes the peace, ſometimes the joy of it are commended unto the world; and all to inflame the hearts of men and women with deſires after it. By all which, and eſpecially by thoſe that have been ſomewhat more largely inſiſted upon, it fully appears, that the face of the Scriptures is ſet like an adamant, fully ſet to exalt holineſſe in the world, to make the generation of the ſons and daughters of men, a generation of ſons and daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by being <hi>partakers of the divine nature, holy as he is holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we ſhall not need to inſiſt at all upon the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> the examples of perſons eminent in holineſſe, over whoſe names and memories the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ſo much, and ſeem to embalm them with honour, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that being preſerved, the world by them might learn to love and <hi>follow holineſſe</hi> in all ſucceeding generations. The ſtories of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as alſo of all the <hi>holy</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:111412:48"/> Prophets and Apoſtles, with many others that are upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture record; <hi>ſpeak plainly</hi> and <hi>without</hi> any <hi>parable,</hi> that the Scripture deſigne is, to make the <hi>holineſſe</hi> of theſe men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate in the world, the men themſelves being dead. So that the light of this Truth ſhines cleerly from all quarrers of the Scriptures, and is ſpread round about us on every ſide; that <hi>holineſſe</hi> amongſt men, is one of the great prizes, that they run for, and contend and ſtrive about with the world.</p>
            <p>Now then (in a word) let us weigh and conſider, what we have gotten all this while, to ſtrengthen the hand of our belief, and ſecure our deareſt ſouls, that the Scriptures preach'd unto us, and profeſs'd by us, are indeed from God.</p>
            <p>If we ſhall but firſt call to minde, what that holineſſe is, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement whereof in the world we have demonſtrated at large, to be one of the great deſignes of the Scriptures; and 2. with what ſtrength and vehemencie and raiſedneſſe of affection and endeavour, this deſigne we ſpeak of, is advanc'd and carried on, by, or in, the Scriptures; the conſideration (doubtleſſe) will amount to a moſt effectuall demonſtration and conviction, that the Scriptures themſelves are from God. For, 1. Let me ask; doth the advancement of <hi>holineſſe</hi> in the world, look like an Intereſt of man, or of any unclean ſpirit? hath it any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the naturall temper, diſpoſition, or deſires of theſe? or hath it not the <hi>expreſſe image and ſuperſcription</hi> of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God upon it, and look like the deſigne of the <hi>moſt holy?</hi> It is a ſaying in naturall Philoſophy; that it is <hi>naturaliſſimum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus viventis, generare ſibi ſimile;</hi> it is the moſt naturall act or work of every living thing, to produce another like unto it ſelf. It is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. that <hi>Adam begat a ſon in his own image, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his likeneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 5. 3.</note>, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. it is ſaid, <hi>that God created man in his own image, and likeneſſe alſo</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1. 26, 27.</note>. If ſuch an <hi>holineſſe</hi> as the Scriptures ſet themſelves with all their might to exalt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate in the world, be the <hi>image</hi> of man, or of any lying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding ſpirit, let either the one or the other be reputed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that doctrine or writing by which the propagation of it is with ſo high an hand (as you have heard) attempted in the world: but if it be the image of God, if it carries an abſolute and perfect reſemblance of his nature in it, <hi>what need
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111412:49"/> we any more witneſſes?</hi> Why ſhould we not conclude without any diffidence or doubtfulneſſe of ſpirit at all, that he, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the author of them?</p>
            <p>Nay ſecondly (that which is yet further conſiderable) the <hi>holineſſe</hi> over which the Scriptures ſo much rejoyce, is ſo far from holding any proportion or correſpondence with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or diſpoſition of man; in this eſtate of corruption and ſin, wherein he now languiſheth even unto death (much more of any creature more abaſed then man) that it profeſſeth enmity, and open hoſtility againſt it; and ſeeketh to turn the temper and waies and courſe thereof upſide down. Whereas on the contrary, it is not only of the moſt rich and full conſiſtencie with the nature of God ſimply, but with that property, attribute, or perfection in his nature, which is his darling, and wherein his ſoul mightily delights (as was lately obſerv'd) as being that, which inclines him to act and put forth himſelf in all the reſt, according to the moſt abſolute and perfect rules for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective actings, and with the greateſt deteſtation of doing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Now then (I beſeech you conſider it) is it any waies like, nay is it poſſible, for the nature, heart, or ſoul of man, which are corrupt, vile and ſinfull, to labour and travail (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſo high a rate, as we have ſhewed you the Scriptures doe) with ſuch a pure and glorious conception, as this of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Who can bring a clean thing, out of an unclean</hi> (is <hi>Jobs</hi> queſtion) and his anſwer is, <hi>not one</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Job 14. 4.</note>. <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thorns, or figgs of thiſtles;</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) implying, not only or ſimply, that they doe not ſo, either <hi>gather grapes of thorns, or figgs of thiſtles;</hi> but that there is an abſolute repugnancie in nature, that they ſhould doe either: there being no naturall principle or aptneſſe, either in the <hi>thorn</hi> to bring forth <hi>grapes,</hi> or in the <hi>thiſtle,</hi> to bring forth <hi>figgs.</hi> Which reaſoning of his ſtands upon this known maxime or rule; that where there is not a propriety of cauſe, there cannot be a particularity of effect. So then, there being nothing, no principle in the nature, ſoul, or ſpirit of man, that hath any compliance in point of cauſality, with ſuch a deſigne of holineſſe as we ſpeak of, and as we found driven in the Scriptures, but all things there riſing up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, evident it is, that the deſigne was new begotten or bred
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111412:49"/> there. It is true, there was a time when <hi>Saul alſo was among the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam 19 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>Prophets,</hi> and prophecied, as other Prophets of the Lord did; upon which occaſion that interrogative Proverb firſt took place: <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> But, that is to be conſidered in this caſe, that though <hi>Saul</hi> indeed prophecied, yet he did it, as being more then himſelf when he did it; the text ſaith, that <hi>the Spirit of God came upon him,</hi> and that then <hi>he went prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> ſo that all this propheticall deportment in <hi>Saul,</hi> whether in words, or expreſſions otherwiſe, was from a cauſe or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, every way proportionable to it, I mean the Spirit of God. And in ſuch a ſence, I grant, that men, notwithſtanding the impurity and unholineſſe of their natures and ſpirits, may yet conceive a deſigne of propagating <hi>holineſſe</hi> in the world, yea and bring forth alſo: but in this caſe evident it is, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ſhould be from God, and not from man,</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid: but may not men by the light of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection </seg>
               </label> nature, and help of the law of God written in their hearts, by an improving, refining, and carrying up to a greater height and perfection, thoſe naturall impreſſions of the beauty, loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and excellency of vertue in every kinde, which are in them, as they may by ſtudy and ſtrength of contemplation, attain unto ſuch a frame of heart, as out of which they may very ſeriouſly, and with great earneſtneſſe of affection and deſire, ingage themſelves in ſuch a deſigne of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> as that which hath been repreſented unto you in the Scriptures? Doe not many Heathen Philoſophers, and morall men, as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Plutarch, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> and others, commend vertue, which they call perfection, in all a mans waies, thoughts, words, and works, to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, exhorting and perſwading all men to it? Why then may not the Scriptures, proceed from one or more ſuch men as theſe, and ſo not from God? To this I anſwer three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be it granted, that Philoſophers and ſome of natures prime <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Scholars, both for naturall and morall knowledge and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have done that which is aſcribed to them in the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, have recommended vertue and perfection (as they call both the one and the other) unto the world, and have ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired and ingaged themſelves to reduce the world to thoſe terms of morall excellency, which they preſcribe; yet if this be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111412:50"/> ſuppoſed and granted concerning men, that they have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world in ſuch glory as this, have ſought to make the world righteous and <hi>holy</hi> (in their ſence) is not the ſame much more to be preſumed, and ſuppoſed concerning God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he alſo hath appeared for the ſame purpoſe, and upon terms much more glorious in this kinde, then they? Will God come ſhort of men, in any vertue, in any praiſe, or glory? nay as he reaſons himſelf concerning himſelf in another caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. (both as the former Tranſlation, and <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> out of the Originall, read, and expound the words:) <hi>Shall I cauſe to travail, and not bring forth? ſhall I cauſe to bring forth, and ſhall be barren, ſaith thy God?</hi> Iſa. 66. 9. <hi>i.</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> interprets it, <hi>Qui aliis ſum gignendi Author, annon ipſe gignerem? I that make others to bring forth, ſhould not I bring forth my ſelf?</hi> ſo may we ſay of him in this: Shall he cauſe others, even Heathen men, and ſuch as are ſtrangers to him (in compariſon) to bring forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and directions, and exhortations unto things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for the behoof and benefit of the world; and ſhall he himſelf be barren, and not doe ſomewhat in the ſame kinde, to advance the eſtate and condition of the world likewiſe? That it is he who originally (at leaſt, if not immediately alſo) gives both wiſdom and underſtanding unto thoſe heathen we ſpeak of, and likewiſe that diſpoſition and frame of will, between which all thoſe books and writings have been begotten and ſet forth unto the world, whereby they call the world to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (in their notion) is not to be queſtioned: for he it is <hi>that gives life and breath, and all things unto all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, this being granted and ſuppoſed, that God, is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and carefull as well as men, to nurture and train up the world in things that are excellent, certainly he hath his means; 1. his Laws, his Precepts, his Inſtructions, his Incouragements for ſuch a purpoſe, and theſe extant, and to be had in the world, as well as they. If ſo, then queſtionleſſe, thoſe means in this kinde, thoſe Laws, Precepts, Inſtructions, Incouragements, that are of the moſt exact calculation, of greateſt efficacie and power amongſt all their fellows, for the carrying on and advancement of this great deſigne, I mean of carrying up the world unto perfection, muſt needs be looked upon as the means of God; the means of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111412:50"/> his immediate appointment and deſignation for the work. So then if this one thing further be but granted, (which I preſume no man hath the leaſt colour, no nor yet the leaſt thought of heart to deny) <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures have the preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie above all other writings whatſoever, in ſtrength, authority and power, to teach the world all the waies of excellencie and perfection, it undeniably follows, that then theſe Scriptures are from God. This is the firſt thing we anſwer to the objection propounded: though men have done the beſt they can, and this poſſibly very conſiderable in the kinde, to exalt a thing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like holineſſe in the world; yet except it ſhould appear, that ſomewhat that hath been done by them in this kinde, hath a greater and more efficacious tendencie hereunto, then the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; the conſideration is ſo farre from weakning the Divine Originall of them, that it rather confirms and gives teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to it. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer yet further: that that morall excellency or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> which the Philoſophers, and learned men of the world, have laboured in their writings to promote amongſt men, is quite another thing, and of a farre inferiour nature to that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he, who in, and by the Scriptures, hath to doe with the world, labours by them, to fill the world withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> which is the Scripture deſigne upon the world, differs from that morall excellency and perfection (ſo called) wherewith Philoſophers were deſirous to plant the world, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waies; but chiefly theſe three. 1. The <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which the Scriptures ſet themſelves to exalt in the world, is a perfect and intire <hi>holineſſe,</hi> it wants no limb or member to complete it: there is never an impreſſion of worth and excellency imaginable, whether in relation to God or men, whereof the heart or ſoul of man is capable, never a ſtrein of action or deportment in what caſe, or upon what occaſion ſoever, that is truly comely and honourable for men, but is compriz'd and comprehended in that <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which the Scriptures recommend unto the world: But for that holineſſe (if you will needs ſo call it) or rather that morall perfection, which is of humane recommendation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, take the faireſt and moſt perfect draughts that ever were made of it by any, you will finde it halt and maimed, many parts
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111412:51"/> or pieces of it wanting. <hi>I have ſeen an end</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God) <hi>of all perfection: but thy commandement, or thy Law, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 96.</note>. A man may ſee from the <hi>Dan</hi> to the <hi>Beerſheba</hi> of that morall perfection, which men either have, or ſhall at any time, invite the world unto; a man may fadome and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, gather it into his underſtanding, and be able to ſay, here I have it, the whole element of it; which plainly ſhews the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it: but the compaſſe and extent of that perfection or <hi>holineſſe</hi> which the Law of God, the Scriptures, call the world unto, is ſo vaſt and large, that the reaſon, conſcience and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man, when they have ſpent themſelves in travell to make a perfect diſcovery of this continent, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of it, cannot yet come to the utmoſt bounds and limits of it: There is a <hi>Terraincognita.</hi> an unknown land of <hi>holineſſe</hi> in the Scriptures, on which no mans underſtanding ever ſet foot to this day. <hi>Who knows</hi> (ſaith the ſame Prophet) <hi>how oft he offendeth?</hi> or (as our laſt Tranſlation hath it) <hi>who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 12.</note> 
               <hi>his errour?</hi> If a man could comprehend the Law of God in the whole extent and compaſſe of it, he might be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand his errours, and to know <hi>how oft he offendeth.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> have this ſaying, that <hi>God left nothing in all the world, wherein he gave not ſome commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture holineſſe, differs from that perfection which the choiſeſt of men have deſired to promote in the world; in the purity or cleanneſſe of it. It hath not only all the parts of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> all things appertaining unto the greateſt excellencie or perfection, that men are capable of (as was noted in the former difference) but it hath no ingredient or mixture in it, of any thing that is repugnant unto true <hi>holineſſe,</hi> or perfection; it is an <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which (as we uſe to ſay of ſolid and compact bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) is <hi>plena ſui,</hi> 'tis full of it ſelf, and hath nothing heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall within it. Whereas the Philoſophers <hi>ointment,</hi> hath many <hi>dead flies</hi> in it, which make the whole compoſition, if not to ſtink rightout, yet to ſend forth ſuch a ſavour, as by which it may be evidently ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nted and diſcerned, to be the compoſition of men, and not of God. <hi>Plato</hi> in that perfection or holineſſe which he commends unto the world, beſides many other things condemned by the Scriptures, as unlawfull, allowes that unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111412:51"/> pollution which they call <hi>paederaſtia,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 27. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes ſeverall of his vertues of ſuch things, habits and actions, which the Scriptures make vices and ſinnes: as 1. He makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> grief or indignation at the proſperity of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, to be a vertue; which the Scripture prohibits, as a thing ſinfull and unworthy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. So again, he makes a vertue of <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eph 5 4.</note> that which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> a diſpoſition to jeſting, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diſcourſe, which the Scripture expreſly prohibits in the very terme, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. So he makes his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines to be, the judging of a mans ſelf worthy of great things, when he is ſo, another of his vertues; a diſpoſition which we know the Scriptures doe not allow in men of the greateſt worth and excellencie under heaven. <hi>So likewiſe ye</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples) <hi>when you have done all thoſe things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants: we have done that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 10.</note> 
               <hi>which was our duty to doe</hi> &amp;c. If you look into <hi>Seneca,</hi> you ſhall finde indeed many excellent precepts of morality, with motives and arguments very conſiderable, to perſwade to them; but you ſhall finde many a <hi>dead flie</hi> in this mans box alſo; and among others, you ſhall finde him commending that as a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous reſolution in <hi>Cato,</hi> rather to lay violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and deſtroy his own life, then to fall into the hands of his enemy <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though there was little queſtion but that he ſhould have had his life, yea and honour too, from him; A practice which the Authour of the latter book of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi> commends likewiſe in one <hi>Razis</hi> a Jew (2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 14. <note place="margin">2 Mac. 14. 41.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 41. to the end) by which character (among ſome others of like nature) Proteſtant Divines have unanimouſly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that thoſe books are not Canonicall, or of divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you ſearch into all the greateſt maſters of morality that ever nature ſet up to teach the world perfection, you will finde even in thoſe of the greateſt and choiſeſt accompliſhments amongſt them, many things taught under the names of vertue and perfection, which are imperfections, and things truly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the nature of man. This is that which the holy Ghoſt himſelf ſeems to take notice of concerning them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>They became vain in their thoughts,</hi> or reaſonings (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>and their fooliſh heart was darkned; profeſſing themſelves wiſe, they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111412:52"/> became fools. Profeſſing themſelves</hi> teachers of perfection, they taught the world imperfection, and things unworthy of them. But if we look into the Scriptures, we ſhall finde that they teach holineſſe and perfection ſo, and upon ſuch tearms, that they teach nothing elſe; they teach no unholy or imperfect thing with them. As <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a ſaying, <hi>Prov. 10. The bleſſing of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 22.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord it maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi> So the Scriptures endeavour to make men holy, and they adde no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe, nothing that defileth with it. <hi>The Law of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of the Scriptures, according to their growth in his dayes) <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect:</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, <hi>the Commandment of the Lord is pure:</hi> and again, <hi>the fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever. The fear of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lord is clean,</hi> i. that reverence and fear of God which is taught in the Scripture, or, which is conceived and begotten in the ſouls and conſciences of men according to the tenour of Scripture commands, leads a man to no impure or unclean action, nay reſtrains him from all ſuch: and therefore <hi>it endureth for ever,</hi> i. prepares and qualifies a man for a bleſſed eternity. For as ſin and death, <hi>i.</hi> the loſſe of being, are of kin, the one making way for the other: ſo are righteouſneſſe and life, or perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of being, the one is a foundation proper for God to build the other upon. But this by the way. You ſee then a 2. plain difference, between that holineſſe which the Scripture teacheth, and that which is, or can be taught by men, otherwiſe then by the Scriptures; the one is pure and clean, the other adulterate, and mixt with unholineſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly, to this particular) That <hi>holineſſe</hi> or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the Scriptures ſo much magnifie, and ſeek to adorn and bleſſe the world withall, conſiſts (the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of it,) in the due deportments and carriages of the heart and ſoul towards God immediately; in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impreſſions, or diſpoſitions, which make a man meet for the enjoyment of God in a way of friendſhip and delightfull communion and converſe: the knowledge of God and of his will, and counſells; the love of God, confidence of the love of God towards him, upon rationall and ſolid grounds; hope or expectation of good from him, dependance upon him for the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111412:52"/> receiving of all good in waies of righteouſneſſe and honour, with many more of like conſideration; all which qualifie and furniſh the creature for communion with God; put him into ſuch a poſture, that God may take a pleaſure and holy content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hold correſpondencie with him; and without which men were no more capable or meet either for communion with, or injoyment of, God, then the wilde beaſts of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are for the ſociety or acquaintaince of wiſe and ſober men. Whereas, if we peruſe the beſt models and draughts of that perfection and excellencie, which have come from men unto the world, and ſhall conſider the particularities of them, you will finde very little, very few things directed or injoyned of any ſuch tendencie as this; the main body or bulk of their writings conſiſting of ſuch precepts and Inſtructions, whoſe conſtitution and frame ſtand either for the regulating of men in their civill and morall deportments in the world, one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and amongſt themſelves, or elſe for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ordering their naturall affections and inclinations, in reference to themſelves, partly that they may receive a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of honour from the world, as of being vertuous, wiſe, and worthy men; and avoid the ſhame and diſhonour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: partly to prevent thoſe inconveniencies, in their eſtates, bodies, friends, poſterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which many times fall heavy upon men of diſſolute and diſordered lives; partly alſo, to nouriſh and maintain a certain calmneſſe and tranquillity of conſcience within; which they found by experience was troubleſome and tormenting unto them, when they had been wicked and vile in any way or practiſe of ſin againſt the light and dictates of it, as the Apoſtle himſelf intimates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <note place="margin">Rom, 2. 14, 15.</note> In the writings and works of ſuch men as we ſpeak of, you may finde many things worthy conſideration, in reference to their ends: but as for either rules or directions, or much urging or preſſing any thing, of any proper and direct tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and ſanctifie men for the immediate worſhip of God, or for any ſpeciall and comfortable communion with him, there is not the proportion of a <hi>gleaning after the vintage,</hi> nor of <hi>the ſhaking of an olive tree, after the gathering of olives</hi> is paſt. <hi>Two or three berries</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) in the top of the uttermoſt bough;</hi>

               <hi>and four or five in the outmoſt fruitfull branches thereof:</hi> ſo there may be here a little, and there a little, a few ſcatter'd notions of ſuch a tendencie as we ſpeak of, to be found here and there in theſe writings: but what they do in this kinde, they do as if they did it not: nor is it much conſiderable what they do. This for the third (and laſt) difference, between that holineſſe, the advancement whereof is the darling deſigne of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world; and that morall perfection, or vice-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (as we may properly enough call it) which nature hath ingaged ſome of the moſt towardly of her ſons to propagate, as they were able, in the world. And ſo much alſo for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing by way of anſwer to the objection propounded: that morall excellencie which Philoſophers and learned men of the world, have laboured in their writings to promote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, is quite another thing, of a farre inferiour nature and worth, to that holineſſe, which he that ſpeaks out of the Scriptures unto the world, would willingly breath into the hearts and lives of men. So that the Divine Originall of the Scriptures, is no waies prejudiced in the evidence and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, by any ſuch conſideration as this; that men either have, or may deſire and endeavour, to ſet the ſame plant in the world. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) though the plant of <hi>holineſſe</hi> we ſpeak of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> ſhould be found the ſame, which both the Scriptures, and men in their writings, joyntly labour and endeavour to plant, and make to grow and flouriſh in the world, yet the different art, method and means, between them, I mean which he uſeth, who plants, in, and by the Scriptures, and thoſe that goe about the ſame buiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and work in other writings, do abundantly demonſtrate, that he that plants by the one, is God; and they that plant by the other, are but men. I ſhall cleare the difference, by giving inſtance only in three particulars, (whereas many more might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be inſiſted upon.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Men doe not, cannot with any ſhew or colour of truth, plead any ſuch ingagements lying upon the world, by reaſon of any ſuch love or kindneſſe that they have ſhewn to it, why the world ſhould hearken unto their voice in this kinde, or hearken unto the Law of their mouth, as he both can and doth, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111412:53"/> teacheth <hi>holineſſe</hi> in the Scriptures. <hi>Plato</hi> cannot ſay, nor can <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> or any other of the great Philoſophers of the world, ſay (nor doe any of them ſay) that they ſo loved the world, and that when it was their enemy, <hi>that they gave their only begotten ſonnes for it.</hi> They have no ſuch golden cords as this, wherewith to draw the hearts of men againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſpoſitions and deſires, to comport with their inſtructions or exhortations unto vertue. This Scepter of love, wherewith the hearts of men moſt delight to be commanded and overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is one of the royalties appropriate to his throne, who by the hand of the Scriptures impoſeth the tax (or benevolence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) of <hi>holineſſe</hi> upon the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor doe they, that ſummon and invite the world to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection in other writings, propoſe unto men any ſuch prizes, any ſuch crowns, ſuch Kingdoms, to ingage them to run the race of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> as he doth, who makes his addreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto the world in this behalf out of the Scriptures: if they ſhould, the world would laugh them to ſcorn, as knowing them unable altogether to make good their ingagements in this kinde. <hi>Will the ſonne of Jeſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saul</hi> to his ſervants, ſtanding about him) <hi>give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make</hi>

            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly,) Nor have the ſons of men, who plead the cauſe of that excellency which they hold forth unto the world, any ſuch priſons, or torments to threaten: they have no worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dieth, no fire that never goeth out, no pit without a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, no lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for ever, wherewith to puniſh thoſe, who ſhall rebell againſt the Laws of their diſcipline and inſtruction. Sometimes they ſpeak of the miſeries and torments which wicked men are like to ſuffer after death; but at meer peradventure, and Poet-like, ſo as more to delight the fancies, then to ſtrike or trouble the conſciences of men. The Hell of Philoſophers, is but like the Hell of the Poets, which is an Hell to play and make ſport withall: it is the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Hell, that makes the hearts, and ſouls, and conſciences, and all that is in men, to quake and tremble.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:111412:54"/>
            <p>This then is the firſt demonſtration that the Scriptures are from God, ariſing from the nature or propertie of the ſubject matter thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the holineſſe of the commands: together with the waies and means wherein they addreſſe themſelves unto the world, to procure obedience unto their commands.</p>
            <p>A ſecond conſideration ſpringing from the ſame root, and tending to a further demonſtration of the ſame truth, is the ſtrong and potent tendencie unto <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> which is found in many of the main carriages and paſſages of the Scriptures, and Goſpel it ſelf. The Scriptures as they drive a glorious deſigne of holineſſe (and that with an high hand of means and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) upon the world (as we have heard) ſo are they every whit as much bent and intent upon another, <hi>viz.</hi> the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world. Inſomuch that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribing the nature and property of the Goſpel in a kinde of periphraſis, calls it <hi>a doctrine according unto godlineſſe. If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſenteth not unto the wholeſome</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3.</note> 
               <hi>words of our Lord Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according unto godlineſſe, he is puft up and knoweth nothing,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according unto godlineſſe,</hi> he cleerly means the Goſpel, that body or frame of truths, precepts, promiſes, and threatnings, which is generally known to us by the name of the Goſpel. Now this he calls <hi>a doctrine according unto godlineſſe,</hi> becauſe the nature, conſtitution, and compoſure of it is ſuch, as if he that framed it, had intended, the exaltation of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> by it in the world; it every waies ſo ſuits and anſwers ſuch a deſigne as this. As God called <hi>David a man after his own heart,</hi> or according to his own heart, becauſe he was willing to <hi>fulfill all his will</hi> or <note place="margin">Acts 13 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>is the myſtery of godlineſſe?</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. it is called, <hi>the truth which is after godlineſſe,</hi> or, according to godlineſſe (in the ſence declared.) Now the Goſpell is call'd a <hi>myſterie,</hi> or, <hi>the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111412:54"/> mystery of godlineſſe,</hi> and the myſteriouſneſſe of it affirmed to be great, becauſe, as it is a doctrine, made (as it were) for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity, and promotion of <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> ſo is it a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or pile of learning, which conſiſts of ſuch truths, and of ſuch ſhews, carriages, and connexions of things, that are very far remote from the common thoughts, reaſons, and underſtandings of men; ſuch as the wiſeſt and moſt inquiring men under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would never have diſcovered or once thought upon, had they not been revealed from heaven by God himſelf unto them. But for the more full opening and cleering the demonſtration in hand, we will obſerve the ſame method in the further handling of it, which we obſerved, in the former: And 1. Shew you what <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is. 2. How mightily intent the Scriptures are, to lift up the horn of it in the world, to propagate and magnifie it in the hearts and lives of men. 3. (And laſtly) We will briefly ponder and weigh the conſideration, that we may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what there is in it to prove the truth of that concluſion we ſeek after, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Goſpel is from God.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe: That <hi>godlineſſe</hi> which the Scriptures bend themſelves with all their might to ſet up and magnifie in the world (as indeed there is none other but this, truly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) is a kinde of heavenly impreſſion, or propenſion in the heart and ſoul of a man, which inclines, and is apt to carry it in all the motions and tendencies of it upon God, or towards God. 1. To cauſe it to remember God and his glory in all the actings and workings thereof, and to raiſe, frame and order theſe in a regular and due proportion thereunto. As we ſee there is a naturall impreſſion or quality of heavineſſe in a ſtone, and in all other heavy bodies, which directs and carries them in their motions in a ſtreight line to the center of the earth, when, or as farre as, impediments unto theſe motions are remov'd out of the way: and ſo again, there is a contrary impreſſion of levity or lightneſſe, in fire, whoſe property is to carry this body in the tendency and motion of it towards the circumference: ſo there is in ſome mens hearts and ſouls, a gracious and heavenly propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which makes them hang and lean God-wards, and in their actions and motions to look towards him, and his glory, and to comply with them; And this propenſion or inclination in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111412:55"/> ſoul, we (together with the Scriptures) call <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is a grace or gracious diſpoſition in the ſoul diſtinct from <hi>holineſſe</hi> (in the nature, though not in the ſubject of it) appears, 1. In that <hi>holineſſe,</hi> is often aſcribed unto God, yea more frequently (I conceive) then any other Attribute, at leaſt as frequently as any: but <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is no where attributed unto him. He is often ſaid to be <hi>holy;</hi> but never ſaid to be <hi>godly.</hi> It is true there is a nature or diſpoſition in God, which inclines him in all his actions and motions to comply with himſelf and with his own glory, as well as with the good of the creature; as there is in <hi>godly</hi> men, beſides that principle of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> we ſpeak of, there is a naturall impreſſion which inclines them alſo to comport with themſelves, and with their own bleſſedneſſe and glory, as well as with God and his glory: but as this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in men, would very improperly be called <hi>manlineſſe</hi> or <hi>menlineſſe;</hi> ſo neither doth the holy Ghoſt, take any pleaſure to call the diſpoſition in God we ſpeak of, by the name of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;</hi> but rather chooſeth to expreſſe and diſcover it ſome other way. Now if it were altogether of the ſame import, or the ſame thing with holineſſe, there can hardly any reaſon be given, why holineſſe ſhould be ſtill ſo frequently and familiarly aſcribed unto God, and <hi>godlineſſe</hi> not at all. 2. That there is a difference between them, appears by this; that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto, or enjoyned by the holy Ghoſt as two ſeverall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Seeing therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter) that all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation, and godlineſſe.</hi> So that <hi>holineſſe</hi> of converſation, and <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> or <hi>godlineſſe</hi> of <hi>converſation,</hi> are two diſtinct things: otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that the holy Ghoſt in one and the ſame ſentence exhorts twice to one and the ſame thing, and that in difference of words, as if there were two: which I ſuppoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhewed in all the Scripture beſides.</p>
            <p>The difference between the two ſiſter graces, <hi>godlineſſe</hi> and <hi>holineſſe</hi> (becauſe ſome may deſire to know this by the way) may be thus conceived. <hi>Holineſſe</hi> (in the moſt proper, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary acception of the word) is a gracious diſpoſition, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart or ſoul, where it reſides, unto actions and waies eminently righteous and juſt, with a reall abhorrency of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111412:55"/> contrary, or whatſoever is ſinfull. <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> is a diſpoſition, which inclines the perſon, in whoſe ſoul it taketh place, to act for God, and to make the advancement of his glory, the ſupreme end of their waies and actions. <hi>Holineſſe</hi> may be compared to the luſtre, or brightneſſe which is in gold: <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> to that weightineſſe, or that propenſion in it, which, in the motion of it, carries it towards the center. <hi>Holineſſe</hi> reſpects the nature and quality of the action, and ingageth to a ſerious and zealous recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in theſe: <hi>godlineſſe</hi> reſpects the end of the action, and carries the Agent in his intentions herein, upon God; ſo that though their natures differ, yet the difference is ſuch, that it plainly ſhews, that they are never divided in their ſubject, but that whereſoever the one is, the other muſt needs be alſo. God never ſtirs up the hearts of men, truly and ſeriouſly to deſire, or imbrace, waies that are excellent indeed, but he ſtirs them up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to make him and his glory the ſoveraigne end of them: yea he ſeldom or never ſtirs up men effectually and upon the termes ſpecified, to deſire ſuch waies, or things as we ſpeak of, but he doth it by putting the propenſion of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> firſt into them. When we finde a deſire in them to act for God and his glory, then, and ſeldome or never till then, will men bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to purpoſe, of doing things that are excellent indeed. Reaſons hereof might be given, but the digreſſion would be too burthenſome to the diſcourſe: This little that hath been ſaid concerning the difference, between <hi>holineſſe</hi> ſo much ſpoken of in the former argument, and <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in this, is rather too much on the bye. This then for the firſt thing propounded, what that <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is, which the Scriptures ſeek to fill the world withall.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, was, briefly to conſider how, and after what rate of zeal and endeavour, and to what height the Scripture ſeeks to build up the world in that heavenly affection we ſpeak of, and call <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> 1. It urgeth and preſſeth upon the conſciences of men for it, by way of precept and command: yea 2. It preſſeth for it upon theſe terms, univerſally, I mean in all their waies, works and doings. I put theſe two together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde them together; 1 <hi>Cor. 10. Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> Ye ſee <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:111412:56"/> here 1. Godlineſſe charged in the nature of a duty upon men: <hi>doe all to the glory of God.</hi> Now to doe a thing to the glory of God, requires theſe four things: 1. That the thing or deed which is done, be ſuch for the nature, kinde, or ſubſtance of the act, that it be apt to yeeld matter or opportunity unto men to glorifie God; as all ſuch acts are, which are done according to the Law and commands of God, either generall, or ſpeciall, and no other. 2. That actions thus qualified as touching the nature and kinde of them, be further qualified with duneſſe of circumſtance in time and place. It is true, there are ſome kinde of actions which cannot lightly ſuffer, or degenerate, thorow any defect in theſe, or either of them; as the inward acts of the love of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there are few outward actions, but may. There is no externall act whereby love unto God may be expreſſed, but that the proportion which it hath in the kinde of it for the glorifying of God, may be diſſolved and deſtroyed by a miſtiming, and miſplacing of it. A third thing neceſſary to be done by him that would doe any thing to the glory of God, is; that firſt he conſults with the glory of God, and ſteadily informs himſelf what that would have, or what it requires for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; as a Taylour firſt conſults with the body, for which he is to make a garment, by meaſuring the proportion of it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places, that ſo he may know how to cut and fit the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, and make it ſit comely. In like manner, he that deſires to advance the glory of God by any action, or courſe, muſt be carefull to inform himſelf, what ſteerage and deportment in all particulars will render them moſt advantagious for, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with, ſuch a deſigne. The fourth and laſt thing (which is the chief of the four) required to the <hi>doing of a thing to the glory of God,</hi> is, that the heart and ſoul of a man, in, or before the doing of it, makes a ſecret deed of conſecration or dedication of it to this end; raiſeth and produceth it for this end, and with this intention, that God may be glorified by it. It is true, there may be ſuch a deed of conſecration as we ſpeak of, made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ignorance, of ſuch an action, (one or more) which hath no more aptneſſe in it to afford glory unto God, then a ſtone or a ſcorpion have to nouriſh a childe withall, in caſe the parent ſhould give them unto him: ſuch a deed our Saviour himſelf
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111412:56"/> ſpeaks of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. where he tells to his Diſciples, that <hi>the time</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 2.</note> 
               <hi>would come, that whoſoever killed them, would think he did God ſervice:</hi> Such actions as this, devoted and conſecrated unto God, are no fruits or expreſſions of that heavenly impreſſion in the ſoul, which we call <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> which alwaies requires a true and ſound knowledge of God, but the fruits of ſuch a devotion, whereof ignorance is the mother, and the Prince of darknes the father; offered indeed and conſecrated to the devil for his glory, under a notion or conceit that he is a true God; as the Apoſtle cleerly expreſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice,</hi>

               <hi>they ſacrifice unto devils, and not unto God:</hi> and yet they thought that they ſacrificed them unto God, and ſo intended, not unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as appears by that inſcription upon an Altar at <hi>Athens,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> met with, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23. compared with his anſwer, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon it: The inſcription upon the Altar was this: <hi>To the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God.</hi> Therefore their intent was to ſerve, and ſacrifice to the true God, though <hi>unknown:</hi> which yet more plainly appears, by what the Apoſtle ſpeaks to them upon the occaſion: <hi>Whom therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ignorantly worſhip, him doe I declare,</hi> or make known <hi>unto you.</hi> Now certainly <hi>Paul</hi> did not declare or make known the devil unto them (except haply by accident, and by way of conſequence) but the true God; as appears by the declaration he makes of him in the following verſes, <hi>God that made the world and all things therein</hi> &amp;c. So that evident it is, that however they intended and meant to ſerve and worſhip the true God, yet in deed and in truth they ſerv'd the devil.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, how can this be, that they ſhould be ſaid to ſerve the devil, and not God, whenas they yet intended to ſerve God, and not the Devil; nor had they any whit more knowledge of the devil (as it ſeems) then they had of God? To this</p>

            <p>If it be here yet further demanded; But is it poſſible for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and carnall men, truly and really to ſeek or intend the glory of God in what they doe, though they be miſtaken in the nature and quality of their action, as men truly godly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:111412:57"/> are. Or if they do cleerly and really intend the glory of God, though that which they do, hath no tendencie thereunto, but rather to the contrary, may not this diſpoſition or propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in them which thus inclines them to act for God and his glory, be called godlineſſe? I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That for men to think they pleaſe or honour God, in ſuch and ſuch actions, is one thing; and truly and really to intend to pleaſe him, is another. There is no queſtion but that the men we ſpeak of, ignorant and carnall men, may think that they pleaſe and honour God in the courſe of their lives and waies, and more particularly in ſome ſpirituall actions; our Saviour acknowledgeth as much as this, in that <hi>Joh.</hi> 16 2. (before mentioned) and the Scripture in many places confirms it: but that they truely or ſingly intend the glory of God, either in the one kinde or the other, is no where affirmed. If it be objected and ſaid,</p>
            <p>But doth not <hi>Paul</hi> (ſpeaking of the Jews) <hi>bear them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they had a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> Can men be ſaid to have a zeal of God, or for God, without intending his honour and glory, and that earneſtly, and with ſtrength of intention?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing, men may be ſaid to intend the glory of God two waies, or in a double conſideration; either, 1. Singly or ſimply, or 2. with relation, <hi>viz.</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſome end or ends of their own. Now men that are carnall, and hatefull unto God in their waies, may intend to glorifie God in relation to themſelves, and ſome good they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and expect from him or by him: and thus the Jews were zealous for God and for his glory. They pretended for that, and that very zealouſly, which they verily thought was for the glory of God, as <hi>viz.</hi> to have the righteouſneſſe of the law eſtabliſhed in the world: becauſe they ſuppoſed, this would be an honour to them and to their nation, to have the honour and dignity of the leviticall worſhip, and ceremoniall law, which had been delivered by God unto them and their forefathers, and whereby they had been ſeparated as a people of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, from all the world beſides, for many generations: and withall thought, that if the doctrine of the Goſpel, which the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:111412:58"/> Apoſtles taught concerning juſtification by faith, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, they and their law together ſhould be deſpiſed; and the reſt of the world be brought in to be a people of God, and ſo their priviledge and dignity, which they had a long time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, <hi>viz.</hi> of being the onely people of God in all the world, ſhould be diſſolved and come to nought. And in this ſenſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carnall and ignorant men now, may (and doubtleſſe do) intend the glory of God; they intend, <hi>i.</hi> purpoſe and mean to ſerve, pleaſe and worſhip God, and ſo to glorifie him, in ſuch and ſuch a way as they fancie to themſelves to be pleaſing to God, hopeing <hi>to fare</hi> the better at his hand for it. But this kind of intention to glorifie God, doth not neceſſarily, or alwaies proceed from that gracious diſpoſition in men which we call <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> becauſe it may proceed out of a naturall affection of ſelf-love, and a meer deſire to accommodate and benefit themſelves. If a man hath any kinde of notion or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, as of one that is able to do him good, or evil in one kinde or other (as men that are very ignorant of him in the Goſpel, may) much more, if he conceives of him, as one able to do him the greateſt good, and withall the greateſt evil; he ſhall but act according to the moſt common and ordinary principles of humane prudence, to ſeek to make him his friend; and if he apprehends no other way for this but only the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of him (which is no ſuch ſpirituall or deep ſpeculation but that he very well may apprehend it,) he may very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and purpoſe this glorifying of him. He that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the glory of God upon ſuch terms as theſe only, doth no more, no greater thing then a priſoner ſhould do, in intending to pleaſe or gratifie his jaylour or keeper, knowing that he hath power to make his impriſonment, either more eaſie and comfortable, or elſe more grievous and irkſome to him. And as the gratifying of a mans keeper upon ſuch terms as theſe, would argue no truth of affection or love to his perſon, or any vertuous diſpoſition in him, but onely love to a mans ſelf, and his own eaſe. In like manner, to glorifie God meerly out of relation to a mans ſelf, and ſome end of his own, doth not argue any propenſion of affection or good will towards God, but to a mans ſelf onely.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:111412:58"/>
            <p>But now ſingly and ſimply to intend the glory of God is another thing. It doth not indeed neceſſarily exclude the ſeeking of a mans ſelf or his own good, in a regular and due manner; a man may ſingly and ſimply, and with ſincerity of heart, intend and ſeek the glory of God, and his own good and peace alſo; but it alwaies includes a truth of affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and that grounded and built upon ſound apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſerious conſideration of the infinite worth, grace and goodneſſe of God. So that though a mans own good might be ſeparated from his glorifying of God, and either be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by ſome other means, or elſe be unattainable altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the heart of ſuch a man would lean and hang towards God, and be ſtill ſeeking his glory. As ſuppoſe the center were not the proper place for ſtones, or heavy bodies to reſt, and to be preſerved in upon the beſt terms; yet the apprehenſion, or quality of weight or heavineſſe which is in theſe bodies, would carry them thereunto after the ſame manner that now they move thither: In like manner, though the creature ſhould not apprehend or conceive his own comfort, peace, or glory, to be wrapped or bound up in his glorifying of God, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if he were godly, this diſpoſition or impreſſion upon his heart and ſoul, would beget and breed intentions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of glorifying God in him, yea and act, and carry him out accordingly. Whereas he that intends or ſeeks the glory of God meerly out of a deſire to gain or get ſomething by him, if he were not partaker of ſome ſuch hope and expectation as this, would have no inclination or diſpoſition at all within him to minde his glory. This for anſwer to the queſtion or demand, how its poſſible for ignorant and carnall men, truly and really to ſeek and intend the glory of God, and how this may be done without <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> And thus much to let you underſtand, what the Apoſtle means, by injoyning men to do things to the glory of God. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doth not ſimply injoyn men to do things <hi>to the glory of God,</hi> but univerſally, to do all things to his glory: <hi>Whether ye eat or drink</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or whatſoever ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> The Scriptures you ſee are ſo zealouſly intent and bent upon the exaltation of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world, that they allow
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111412:59"/> nothing to be done in the world, no action whatſoever to paſſe the hearts or hands of men, though of the ſmalleſt and lighteſt conſequence otherwiſe, but what <hi>godlineſſe</hi> ſhall order and direct to be done. Our <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> yea and leſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then theſe, muſt be formed and faſhioned (as it were) by the hand of <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures doe not content themſelves to advance <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world onely by commanding the practice or exerciſe of it, and that univerſally in all things; but further ſeek the promotion of it, by making promiſes unto it, and to the practice of it, and thoſe many, yea and theſe great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Apoſtle informs us, <hi>that godlineſſe is profitable unto all things, having promiſe, or the promiſe of the life which now is, and of that which is to ceme.</hi> And what can a man or woman <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Tim. 4. 8.</note> wiſh or deſire more, then to be well provided for, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly apaid in this life, and to be aſſured of the injoyment of that which is to come? And we ſee that God in the Scriptures hath annexed the promiſes of both theſe unto <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> It were eaſie to inſiſt upon particular promiſes in either kinde, out of other Scriptures. But the Apoſtles authority is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to build upon in this caſe. With how high an hand then doe the Scriptures ſeek to lift up the head of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world, when as they lay down both heaven and earth at the feet of it? The greater and richer the price is, that is held forth to thoſe that ſhall be willing to ſtrive or trie maſteries, and ſhall obtain; it is ſo much the more like that greater numbers will ingage in the race. And in reaſon, the promiſe or offer made both of heaven and earth together unto <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> ſhould make the tents of ungodlineſſe deſolate in one day, and bring in the world from all the four windes of the heavens, to inquire after the laws, and to learn the ſtatutes and judgements thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scriptures are not yet ſatisfied with all this, to make the crown of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> to flouriſh upon the head of it: they further threaten terrible things, as that fire, and hail, ſtorm and tempeſt ſhall be their cup to drink, who ſhall caſt the care and ſtudy of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> behind their back. All theſe arrows of <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 4. 18. 2 Pet. 2. 6. 3. 7.</note> the fiery indignation of the Almighty levell'd at the face of ungodlineſſe, are pillars and ſupporters of the honour of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:111412:59"/> 
               <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and render it ſo much the more lovely and deſirable in the world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Scriptures in order to the advancement of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world, do not only oppoſe and ſeek to ſuppreſſe and keep down her adverſarie, ungodlineſſe, by threatning to ſtay her and her children with death, but preſents and holds forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the dreadfull execution of ſuch threatnings upon ſome. <hi>And ſpared not the old world</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) but ſaved Noah the eight</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5, 6.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. (And laſtly) The Scriptures yet further deſirous to lift up the throne of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> to the higheſt in the hearts and affections of men, ſpeak one glorious thing more of her, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe one excellencie to her, wihch is apt to commend her greatly in the eyes of ſome; they aſcribe a potency, or power unto her. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul (2 Tim.</hi> 2. 5.) ſpeaking of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that ſhould riſe up in the laſt and perillous times, among other characters, by which he there deſcribes them, gives this for one; that they ſhould have a ſhew, <hi>or form of godlineſſe, but would deny the power thereof.</hi> So that here is aſſerted a certain might, or power, <hi>i.</hi> a principle of doing great things, unto <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> We muſt not now ſtand to explain or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen this power; or ſhew either wherein it conſiſts, or unto what actions it extends. But very powerfull certainly it is, where it is in its juſt growth and ſtature; and inables thoſe in whom it is upon ſuch terms found, to do things very ſtrange and wonderfull in the eyes of men, and ſuch as all the world beſides can hardly tell how to turn their hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But that which we have to take notice of for the preſent, is this; that this power which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, reſiding in it, and accompanying of it, is a thing very proper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it in the eyes of men, and to ſet the world on fire with love and deſires after it. The mighty ſtrength or power which is in God, is very uſually call'd his glory; and men (we know) <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> are apt to boaſt, and glory much in their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>This for the ſecond thing propounded; how, and with how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:111412:60"/> high an hand, and upon what terms, the Scriptures riſe up to magnifie that heavenly diſpoſition in the ſoul, which they call <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> with the waies and fruits of it.</p>
            <p>The third (and laſt) follows, which is this; to weigh and conſider what there is in all that hath been ſaid, to bring forth this hidden treaſure into a cleer light, to evince the truth and certainty of this concluſion, that the Goſpell is indeed from God. This you will eaſily apprehend to be exceeding much, if you pleaſe but to call to minde and conſider the two particulars that have been opened and inſiſted upon; as 1. What <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is: and 2. How mightily the Scriptures labour and travail with the promoting of it in the world. The deſigne it ſelf proclaims the great and glorious God, the authour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectour of it, but the manner and high hand of the proſecution of it, is a further confirmation of it, and that in abundance.</p>
            <p>For the deſigne it ſelf (in the firſt place) the exaltation of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world. Who can with any likelihood, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon, be imagined to be the deſigner, the founder or projectour of ſuch a deſigne, but God alone? who could ever have thought of cutting ſuch a channell through the midſt of the world, as <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is, to gather all the ſtreams and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of all the thoughts, ſpeeches, actions and waies of men into it, and here to appoint them ſuch a courſe, as to cauſe them all to fall into that great ocean of the glory of God? <hi>Can any good come out of Nazareth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nathaneel</hi> to <hi>Philip) Joh.</hi> 1. 46. So may we well ask here: can any ſuch good as this, the projecting of the glory of God, come out of the dark, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and corrupt heart of man?</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, you will (I preſume) conceive it the leſſe poſſible, if together with the nature of the deſigne, you will pleaſe to take into conſideration, after what manner, and with how high and glorious an hand it is driven and carried on in the Scriptures. For though it ſhould be granted, that ſome one man or more, by the help and advantage of his naturall endowments or parts, being larger and richer then other mens, and further rais'd by induſtry and contemplation, might attain to ſuch a notion and reſolution as this; that it were a thing juſt and meet that men ſhould plead the cauſe of the infinite
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:111412:60"/> excellency, worth and perfection of God in the world, and ſeek to perſwade all men to preferre him and his glory in all their ends and waies, and ſhould give out himſelf accordingly withall his might and ſtrength to do it (though this be no waies probable, either that ever it hath been, or will be done by any man, as we ſhall further ſhew preſently;) yet that he ſhould manage, or attempt the carrying on, and making good this his deſigne, by ſuch a magnificent and God-like method, at ſuch a rate of power and authority, as we have ſhewed you the deſigne of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> to be carried on by the Scriptures, exceeds all belief much more. To inſtance in ſome of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: was there ever any, or is it any waies like that there ſhould have been any mortall ſinfull man, that would take upon him to promiſe the glory of heaven, and the great things of the world to come, whereof the Scriptures ſpeak, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in his own name, and by his own ſtrength to make good, and that with a majeſtick confidence, ſuch a promiſe, to what ſervice or work done whatſoever, which we know, and have heard, he doth, who pleads the cauſe of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures? Doubtleſſe no mans heart, at leaſt no conſidering or wiſe mans heart, would ever ſerve him to doe it. Again was there ever any man, or any man like to be, or to have been, that ſhould threaten <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> againſt thoſe that would not hearken unto his voice in any of his commands, yea and threaten the execution of his threatnings in this kinde, by the ſtrength of his own arme, as we heard he doth, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, that threatens ungodlineſſe, and ungodly ones in the Scriptures? nay, was there ever any man, who aſſuming unto himſelf the name and power of a God, commanded <hi>godlineſſe</hi> unto the world in his own name; as he doth who gives commands thereof unto men out of the Scriptures? The Apoſtle indeed ſaith of the man of ſin (as he is called) <hi>that he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God:</hi> So <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 4.</note> that he as God <hi>ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing</hi> (or vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) <hi>himſelf that he is God;</hi> i. he aſſumes a power every way equall to the power of God, as <hi>viz.</hi> in diſpenſing with his laws, and preſcribing laws of worſhip, and articles of faith unto men, and it may be thought, that he in this poſture, commands <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:111412:61"/> in the world. But 1. this man, whoſoever he is, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and made known in the Scripture to be an impoſtor, and deceiver of the world: and therefore certainly he was not the authour of the Scriptures; if he were, he would never have writ his own name in ſuch black characters of infamy and reproach. And 2. theſe marks or characters of him, that he ſhould <hi>ſit in the Temple of God as God, and ſhew or vaunt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as God,</hi> are deſcriptive and appropriate unto him; and conſequently imply, that there are no more men in the world of the like pride and impiety, but he. 3. And laſtly it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that he was not the authour of the Scriptures, becauſe they prophecie of his coming into the world, ſome ages after they were finiſhed and completed.</p>
            <p>Others there have been, who to procure the more reverence and authority to the laws which they had a deſire to commend unto, and to eſtabliſh amongſt a people, pretended and gave out, that they had familiarity and conjunction with ſome Deity from whom they received them, as <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Romane</hi> ſtate, <hi>Mahomet</hi> with ſome others. Again, ſome likewiſe there have been, who out of a diabolicall pride, and vanity of minde, would needs be acknowledged and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Gods, as <hi>Alexander</hi> and ſome others. But for theſe latter, by ſuch a ridiculous preſumption as this, they rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to contempt and ſcorn, and loſt the honour of being eſteemed men of wiſedom and worth, then any waies gained any opinion with men of being Gods indeed. As when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſent to the ſtate and citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to apotheiſe, or make him a God, they obeyed him, but with an ironicall obedience; drawing up their act for his Deification in theſe terms; <hi>Quoniam vult Alexander Deus eſſe, Deus eſto.</hi> i. Since <hi>Alexander</hi> will needs be a God, let him be one. Nor were theſe men, I mean that would needs be Gods, any great Patrons or advocates of <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> As for the former, thoſe who onely pretend, and aſſerted a divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall unto their laws; hereby plainly acknowledged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes't themſelves not to be Gods. Nor doubtleſſe hath there ſuch a thing ever been heard of ſince the foundations of the world, that a man, eſpecially a ſober man, and of a capacity to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111412:61"/> write the things contained in the Scriptures, ſhould in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the world proclaim himſelf to be the great God that made heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>If any man be not yet ſatisfied with the demonſtration in hand, but ſhall ſtill queſtion and doubt, whether a meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, exerciſing himſelf in the book and law of creation and providence, night and day, may not by ſuch a ſtudy and ſearch as this, come to a cleer and perfect diſcovery of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection of God; and conſequently that he is <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of thoſe who ſhall diligently ſeek him,</hi> and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory: and whether upon ſuch a diſcovery as this, he may not readily come to this concluſion, that it is a thing moſt reaſonable, juſt, and equall, and worthy all men, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him, who is infinitely excellent and worthy, to whoſe praiſe and glory, all creature intereſts and ingagements ſhould ſubmit and ſtoop, and conſequently ingage himſelf with all his ſtrength and all his might to perſwade the world hereunto; eſpecially conſidering (that which ſuch a man may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend alſo) that there is no courſe he can take, like unto this, to commend himſelf, to him that is infinite in perfection, and ſo to advance his own happineſſe. If ſuch a chain as this be ſtrong, and will hold in all the links of it, why may it not be poſſible, yea and probable in ſome degree, that a meer man might compoſe the Scriptures, any thing that is there ſaid for the advancement of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> notwithſtanding? To this I anſwer (and ſo conclude this argument,)</p>
            <p n="1">1. (By way of conceſſion) That there is no queſtion to be made, but that naturall men, by an induſtrious and diligent culture and improvement of their naturall endowments and abilities, may go very farre in making ſuch diſcoveries, as are mentioned in the objection; and particularly may come to take hold of this concluſion, and that with cleerneſſe and confidence, that God is infinitely perfect, perfect above all created perfection whatſoever, from which all the reſt of the particulars mentioned in the objection, ſeem cleerly deducible, without any reluctancie, or gainſaying of reaſon, in any of them.

For the inviſible things of him (i.</hi> of God) <hi>from the creation of the world, i.</hi> ever ſince men were, and had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>are cleerly ſeen, i.</hi> are cleerly to be ſeen, may cleerly and plainly enough be ſeen (the Greek tongue wanting <hi>gerunds,</hi> as the Latine Grammarian calls them, ſtill uſeth the paſſive voice in ſtead of them, as we have often heretofore, upon the like occaſion, given notice) <hi>are cleerly ſeen, being underſtood</hi>

So then the infinite perfection of God, being one of his <hi>inviſible</hi> things, and ſomewhat of that, which may be known of him, or as appartaining to him: yea, and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and eſſentiall attribute of his Godhead, evident it is, that a naturall man, by a diligent exerciſe and improvement of his abilities, may attain the certain knowledge of it. But yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer by way of exception, that though a naturall man, may very poſſibly attain to a certain knowledge, that God is infinitely perfect, yea and poſſibly goe along with this knowledge as farre as it is able to carry him, and particularly be led by it unto all thoſe concluſions, reſolutions and practiſes mentioned in the objection; yet notwithſtanding it is the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:111412:62"/> of improbabilities or unlikelyhoods, that ever ſuch men will do it, I mean, go along with, and follow this principle or concluſion, that <hi>God is infinitely perfect,</hi> in all ſuch practicall waies and ingagements, which that is apt and proper to lead unto; and more particularly, that ever they will be brought to the ingagement (chiefly inſiſted upon in the objection) <hi>viz.</hi> to perſwade the world, with all their might and all their ſtrength, <hi>whether they eat, or whether they drink, or what ever elſe they doe, to doe all to the glory of God;</hi> I ſay it is a thouſand times ten thouſand to one, that no naturall man will ever be brought to ingage himſelf in any ſuch ingagement as this. The Scripture affirms a generall averſeneſſe and indiſpoſition in men (yea in the beſt of naturall men) to ſuch a thing: and we know that where there is no diſpoſition, no will to doe that which is our duty to doe, any power or abilitie to doe it ſerves for little, but only to <hi>leave us without excuſe</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) and to juſtifie God in our condemnation. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of the beſt and moſt conſiderable amongſt the ſons of nature, the Philoſophers and wiſe men and diſputers of this world, in the fore-mentioned chapter <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 28.) ſaith thus of them. <hi>And as they did not like to retain God in knowledge</hi> (the word <hi>their,</hi> in a different letter in your Bibles, inſerted by the Tranſlatours, were much better out then in; for it much darkens the Apoſtles ſence in the place) <hi>God gave them over to a reprobate minde, to doe things that are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 1. 28.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111412:63"/> thoughts.

               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that though there was, and is in naturall men, a power of laying out themſelves to the uttermoſt for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world; yet this being a bare logicall power (as we call it) <hi>i.</hi> a power accompanied with no manner of inclination to act according to it, nay incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and compaſſed about with a thouſand ſinfull diſtempers and diſpoſitions, which all oppoſe and riſe up againſt the due exerciſe and actings of it, it is no waies likely, nay it is next to an abſolute impoſſibility, yea every whit as much as a morall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, that any man ſhould ever be found to riſe up, in the due and juſt imploiment and improvement of it; or conſequently, ſhould be the authour of the Scriptures. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Suppoſe there ſhould ſuch a man be found amongſt the many millions of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, in whoſe eye the glory of God ſhould be ſo dear and precious, as that the deſire of the advancement of it ſhould be predominant in his ſoul, and over-rule and put to ſilence, all thoſe contrary riſings and reaſonings that warre againſt the utmoſt improvement of that power, which ſuch a man may poſſibly be conceiv'd to have, for the glorifying of God, or promoting <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world; yet could not this man be reaſonably judg'd or look'd upon as the enditer, or compoſer of the Scriptures. One reaſon (amongſt others) is this: becauſe he that in the Scriptures, preſents and makes himſelf the authour and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Scriptures, and pleads the cauſe of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> with ſo high an hand, avoucheth himſelf for God (as we ſhewed before) now if a man ſhould pretend, or undertake to plead the cauſe of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> with never ſo high an hand, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form accordingly, and in the mean time affirm himſelf to be God; he ſhould moſt notoriouſly &amp; deſperately prevaricate with the cauſe he undertakes, and plead for the advancement of the glory of a ſinfull and corruptible man, under a ſhew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:111412:63"/> of pleading for the glory of the incorruptible God; and ſo could not be ſaid to advance <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be yet ſaid, but may not, or might not ſuch a man, take the name of God unto himſelf in the Scriptures, with upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, and much prudence for the advancement of his deſigne? Might he not conceive and think, that ſuch a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as the Scriptures hold forth for the advancement of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> would be more authoritative and taking in the world, if it ſhould come unto it in the name of God, as compos'd and fram'd by God himſelf? If ſo, then is his aſſuming the name of God in the Scriptures, no prevaricating with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of lifting up <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the world, but rather a wiſe and prudent expedient for the furtherance of it. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (and ſo conclude.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is no waies likely (ſcarce a thing poſſible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) that a man ſo farre rais'd in zeal and fervencie of ſpirit, for the advancement of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> as to ingage and act in it and towards it, according to the proportion and meaſure of the Scriptures, ſhould not underſtand and apprehend, that for any man to intend or propoſe to himſelf the advancement of Gods glory by any lie or untruth, is to ſinne with an high hand againſt <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and to take a direct courſe to overthrow that, which he pretends to build up. For when that lie, which is made the baſe or corner ſtone of the building, ſhall be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and found out (as all lies are in danger of being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every hour) the world will ſo much the more abhorre the ſuperſtruction, and that which was built upon it.</p>
            <p>Nor 2. Doth it ſtand with the honour of the holineſſe and purity, of the wiſedome and power of God, for ſo many thouſand years together, as the Scriptures have now ſerv'd him, to ſuffer that great and ſacred affair of his glory, his deereſt intereſt in the world, to be managed and promoted, by the unſanctified hand, and polluted agency of a lie. <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to his three friends) <hi>for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</hi> and verſ. 9. <hi>doe ye mock him, as one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 13 9.</note> 
               <hi>man mocketh another:</hi> in the former tranſlation it was; <hi>will you make a lie for him, as one lieth for a man? q. d.</hi> it is a moſt diſhonourable thing unto God, unworthy his holineſſe, his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:111412:64"/> wiſedome, his power, to think that he ſtands in need, or will accept with the leaſt approbation, any mans lie, any mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit for the building up of his glory; being ſo abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with wiſedome and power as he is, to ſerve himſelf in this kinde, yea to procure himſelf to be ſerv'd by men with truth and holineſſe. Doubtleſſe if he that fram'd the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, had been conſcious to himſelf, of ſpeaking ſo deceitfully, of making ſuch a prodigious lie for God, as to ſay that he himſelf was God being a man; he would never have put ſuch a ſharp reproof againſt his own practiſe, into the mouth of ſo juſt and holy and vertuous a man as <hi>Job</hi> was, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own report and account of him. But we have (I ſuppoſe) driven this argument ſo farre, that there is little or nothing left to oppoſe it with any colour of reaſon, which hath not been anſwered; or at leaſt that ſaid, which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>A 3. Argument from the matter of the Scriptures, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their originall from God, is, their ſtanding up with that great authority and power, to call the world, even all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof to that which they call, a <hi>deniall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> to conjure them with that high hand of importunitie and motive, into a <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> frame of heart and ſoul, with waies and practiſes anſwerable thereunto. Such an attempt as this upon the world, eſpecially ſo proſecuted, and followed with means ſo proper and likely effect it, as the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the matter unto us, is a ſtrong and potent inducement to any man that ſhall duly and diligently conſider it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God and not man is the great architect, builder and contriver of them. Let me (according to the method we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in handling the two former demonſtrations) ſhew you (in a word) what that <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> is, which the Scriptures ſo much commend unto the world, and we now hold forth unto you, as a teſtimony of their proceeding from God. Secondly, how and after what manner, by what arguments and motives, the Scriptures deal and treat with the world to caſt it into this heavenly ecſtacie of <hi>denying</hi> it ſelf. Thirdly, and laſtly, we will conſider what weight of reaſon or proof there is in the one, and in the other, to make good the claim of the Scriptures,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:111412:64"/> wherein they avouch God for their father.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that heavenly plant of <hi>ſelf deniall,</hi> which the Scriptures ſeek to furniſh the world withall, and to plant in the hearts and lives of men, may be conſidered, either in the root, or in the fruit of it. By the root, I mean the inward principle or frame of heart, out of which a man is not only inabled, but inclin'd alſo, and ſweetly diſpoſed to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. By the fruit, I mean all thoſe outward expreſſions, and deportments in a mans life and converſation, which flow from ſuch a principle, and anſwer the nature of it. Now this ſelf-deniall, in the principall or root of it, may be thus deſcribed: It is ſuch a diſpoſition or frame of heart in a man, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him, <hi>i.</hi> makes him willing and ready, to neglect himſelf in all perſonall and ſelf-accommodations eſpecially in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, when, and as the glory of God, and generall good of men require it for their furtherance and advancement. We ſhall not now ſtand to examine this deſcription in all the particulars of it. The nature or main property of <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> lies in this; to make a man ready and willing to ſubmit and ſubject himſelf and all his ends, intereſts, and injoyments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, unto the glory of God, and good of men, according to the occaſions, and exigencies of theſe. So that when a man hath a call and opportunity to do ſome ſpeciall ſervice unto God, or men, but yet he cannot doe either, but either with the hazard, or certain loſſe of ſome private and perſonall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of his own, whether matter of pleaſure, profit, credit, liberty, life, or the like, if in this caſe he ſhall reſolve to doe the ſervice however, whatſoever it coſts him out of his own intereſts, or how croſſe ſoever the doing of it proves to to his naturall inclinations or deſire, ſuch a man may be ſaid to <hi>deny himſelf</hi> in that action or ſervice. And if a man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly principled and uniformly diſpoſed to act upon ſuch terms as theſe, he may properly be ſaid to be a <hi>denier of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of the term, I mean why ſuch a gracious habit or principle as we ſpeak of, is called, the deniall of a mans ſelf, I conceive is this: becauſe he that doth things contrary to his own intereſts, and to the diſaccommodating of himſelf, doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:111412:65"/> (as it were) deny that there is any ſuch perſon in being as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As he that acts contrary to the intereſts of God in the world (I mean his honour and glory) is ſaid to <hi>deny him (in works,) in works they deny him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>i.</hi> they doe <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> ſuch things, and live after ſuch a manner, that men are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (at leaſt) and have an occaſion thereby miniſtred unto them, to think there is no ſuch nature or being, as God; even as they have, when men expreſſe themſelves in words againſt the being of God, and ſay, <hi>there is no God:</hi> ſo likewiſe when men ſhall doe things which are (or ſeem) contrary to their being or well being in the world, they may be ſaid (in ſuch a ſenſe) to <hi>deny themſelves; i.</hi> to goe to work, as if they would perſwade men, that there are no ſuch perſons of men in the world, as they. As on the contrary, men are ſaid to confeſſe God, or confeſſe Chriſt in the world, not only (nor indeed ſo much) when in words they ſay, there is a God, or there is a Chriſt in being; as when they either doe or ſuffer ſuch things, which were no waies reaſonable for men either to doe, or ſuffer, but only upon this ſuppoſition, that there is a God, and there is a Chriſt, and that ſuch, both the one and the other, as the Scripture repreſents and affirms them to be. In the ſame manner of phraſe and expreſſion, men may be ſaid to confeſſe themſelves, in oppoſition to a <hi>denying of themſelves,</hi> when they act meerly according to their own intereſts, and for their own benefit and pleaſures, eſpecially at ſuch times and in ſuch caſes, wherein the glory of God, and the good of men, doe in a way of reaſon and equity challenge a waving of all ſelf-reſpects, and ſelf-ſeeking at their hand. If in ſuch caſes as theſe, men inſtead of their not minding, not regarding themſelves and their own concernments, ſhall deſpiſe the intereſts of God and men, acting for themſelves as if there were neither God, nor any man or men beſides themſelves, they may according to the honour of the Scripture phraſe we ſpeak of, be called ſelf-confeſſours or avouchers of themſelves. This for the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: what that deniall of a mans ſelf is, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call the world unto; which call of theirs, we affirm to be that perfect and diſtinct voice of the glorious God himſelf, ſpeaking out of the Scriptures, as from a throne of holineſſe unto
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:111412:65"/> the world: So that theſe Scriptures may hereby alſo (amongſt other ſignes and means of diſcovery) be known to be from God.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let us with like brevity conſider, how and after what manner, by what arguments and motives it calleth the world unto that deniall of it ſelf, which hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By expreſſe precept or command. <hi>Let no man ſeek his own; but every man anothers wealth. i.</hi> anothers good, anothers comfort. <hi>Let no man ſeek his own wealth,</hi> but every man the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 24.</note> wealth of other. <hi>i.</hi> let no man minde, regard or ſeek his own intereſt or wealth, apart from, much leſſe in oppoſition to the <hi>wealth</hi> and comfort of other men. He commands, that no man ſuffers his own wealth, or contentment in any kinde, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between him, and his faithfull endeavours to promote the good of others. Not but that it is lawfull for any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to ſeek their own good; but it muſt be with a tender eye had to the good of others, and with ſubordination thereunto. If at any time there falls out a caſe of competition, our own perſonall and private benefit and good muſt give place to the good of many: as the Lord Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, and of the end of his coming into the world; that he <hi>came not to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth 20. 28. Mark 10. 45.</note> 
               <hi>unto, but to miniſter, and to lay down his life aranſome for many.</hi> So the will and command of God is, that men ſhould ſo live in this preſent world, as if every man were dead unto himſelf, and alive unto another; <hi>i.</hi> had no wiſedom, ſtrength, care, time, will, neceſſary occaſion, to act for himſelf, and his perſonall concernments in the outer man, but could finde all theſe in good proportion to act for the publique good, and for <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 16.</note> other men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Scriptures command that <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> we ſpeak of, ſo doe they incourage and preſſe unto it by the great example of the Lord Chriſt himſelf, they hold forth this pattern in the mount, and cry aloud unto the world, commanding every man to doe likewiſe. <hi>We which are strong</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves. i.</hi> not to ſeek the eaſe or contentment of the fleſh or outer man, with the diſcontent or neglect of any. For otherwiſe if the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:111412:66"/> promoting of the good of other men, be a thing <hi>pleaſing</hi> to us, (as indeed it ſhould) we may very lawfully, yea and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably <hi>pleaſe our ſelves:</hi> and yet this <hi>pleaſing of our ſelves</hi> in that excellent and worthy thing we ſpeak of, ſhould not be the chief <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> end neither, why we doe it. In the very next words the Apoſtle extends the exhortation beyond thoſe who are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and chargeth the ſame duty (in effect) upon every man: <hi>Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man pleaſe his neighbour in that which is good</hi> (or, for his good) <hi>to edification. i.</hi> let him ſubject his own ends, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to the ſpirituall good (eſpecially) of other men. And to binde this exhortation yet cloſer to the conſciences of all men, he makes uſe of the golden cord of the example of Chriſt himſelf, in the next words: <hi>For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee;</hi> or, the rebukes of them that rebuked thee, <hi>fell on me. Even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, ſince Chriſt himſelf, who above all the men under heaven might in reaſon have been diſpenſed with, and excuſed in this behalf, I mean from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his own pleaſure, eaſe, comforts and peace, unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, yet was willing to ſacrifice all the intereſts he had in the world, upon the ſervice of the pleaſure, peace and comfort of others, even of thoſe that had <hi>reproached,</hi> or <hi>rebuked</hi> God, that is, of ſinfull men; ſin being a reproaching, or rebuking of God; a diſhonour or affront put upon him. This motive unto <note place="margin">1 Joh 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> drawn from the great example of the Lord Chriſt, is elſewhere made uſe of by the Scriptures, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew that the example of the Lord Chriſt in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, though it's true, he was not (in a ſence) <gap reason="foreign">

In this ſence he was not <hi>freo from men,</hi> but a debtour to them; yet in the ſence he means, he was <hi>free from all men;</hi> but however, <hi>he made himſelf a ſervant unto all: i.</hi> he did not minde or act his own work, his own buſineſſe in the world; he did not drive any deſigne of making himſelf great, or rich, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, with the greatneſſe, riches, or honours of the world; but minded the buſineſſe of other men; when he did work for himſelf (I mean upon his occupation of tent-making) he wrought rather for others, then for himſelf: his <hi>hands</hi> (as ſomewhere he ſpeaks) <hi>ministred unto his neceſſities,</hi> yea <hi>to the neceſſities of thoſe that were with him, that he might not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto others.</hi> He ſubjected all his own temporall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>things,</hi> to their <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things; he built up their inner man, as it were, with the ruines and ſpoils of his own outer man. And this example of himſelf, he declares and holds forth to the world, to invite others into the ſame ſpirit and practiſe of <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> with him.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111412:67"/> with perſecutions, and in the world to come, eternall life.</hi> A like paſſage you have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 29. And elſewhere you have this <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 29. Matth. 10 39.</note> promiſe from the ſame hand: <hi>he hath looſeth his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it,</hi> and proportionably, whatſoever elſe a man ſhall loſe for Chriſts ſake, beſides his life, he ſhall finde that alſo; <hi>i.</hi> a full and rich conſideration for it, in the life or world to come. Now a man may be ſaid <hi>to loſe his life</hi> (and ſo any other thing) <hi>for Chriſts ſake,</hi> not onely by ſuffering death, rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Chriſtian profeſſion; but likewiſe when he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf unto death, or come's to taſt of death, for the performance of any duty or ſervice in what kinde ſoever, which Chriſt hath commanded him. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>for the work of Chriſt he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life to ſupply that ſervice which was lacking on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 30.</note> 
               <hi>the Philippians part towards him.</hi> Now in caſe <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had loſt his life, through his zeal and faithfullneſſe to ſtand by <hi>Paul</hi> in his diſtreſſe, and to miniſter unto him, he might as truly have been ſaid to have <hi>loſt his life for Chriſts ſake,</hi> as if he had died, becauſe he would not deny, or renounce the name of Chriſt. And ſo whatſoever a man ſuffers loſſe of, or deprives himſelf of beſides, for keeping any of the <hi>words,</hi> obeying any the commands of Chriſt, he doth in true account ſuffer loſſe of it for Chriſts ſake. This is a fourth method, or way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scriptures labour to caſt the world into that heavenly ecſtacie of ſelf-deniall; <hi>viz.</hi> by provoking men to drink their fill of the hope and expectation of the glory and great things of the world to come.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, They have yet another formidable engine whereby to bow and bend the world unto a <hi>deniall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or elſe to batter and break them in pieces; <hi>viz.</hi> the threatnings of the wrath and <hi>vengeance which is to come, of the worm that never dieth,</hi> and of <hi>the fire that never goeth out.</hi> I ſhall onely inſiſt upon two places for this purpoſe: The one is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37, 38, 39. The other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29. 30. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 37, 38, 39.</note> place our Saviour expreſſeth himſelf thus. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me. And he that loveth ſonne or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not up his croſſe and followeth after me, is not worthy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:111412:67"/> of me. He that will finde his life ſhall loſe it,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt, What is it to <hi>love father or mother, ſonne or daughter,</hi> and other things proportionably, <hi>more then Chriſt?</hi> It is to preferre the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, or our contentment in them, before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or (which is the ſame) before our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience unto the will and commands of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So that when it comes to a caſe of competition, between do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of Chriſt, and pleaſing a <hi>father or mother,</hi> gratifying a ſonne or a daughter, we chuſe rather to pleaſe or gratifie theſe, then to do the will of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> verſ. 8. We know it is the will and command of Chriſt, that <hi>men ſhould labour, not ſo much for the meat that periſheth, as for that which indurent to eternall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 27.</note> 
               <hi>life.</hi> Now in caſe we have parents that are carnall, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and worldly, and would have us to be like unto themſelves, and ſhall be offended at us, and perhaps threaten to caſt us off, or the like, in caſe we ſhall apply our ſelves in any ſerious or intenſe manner to the means of grace and of ſalvation, as in frequenting religious exerciſes, converſing much with good company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if in his caſe, we ſhall neglect the beſt means of ſalvation we can injoy, or abſtain from holy exerciſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain good company, to keep our intereſts in the affections and good will of our parents, we may be ſaid to love, father, or mother, more then Chriſt. So we know it is the will of Chriſt, that thoſe that <hi>are rich in this world, ſhould doe good,</hi> and not ſimply ſo, <hi>but that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.</note> 
               <hi>willing to communicate,</hi> &amp;c. Now if men that are rich, and have full eſtates, and are forehanded in the world, to gratifie their children, and make them great on earth, as either by matching of them, or ſtocking of them, or leaving them ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, or ſo many thouſands when they die, ſhall neglect that commandment of Chriſt whilſt they live, and be penurious and pinching, and poor in good works, backward to <hi>diſtribute</hi> and to <hi>communicate</hi> unto thoſe that want; theſe may truly be ſaid to love ſons or daughters more then Chriſt. There is the like reaſon in other things.</p>
            <p>But what doth our Saviour mean, by that expreſſion, <hi>is not worthy of me?</hi> This is a figurative expreſſion, wherein the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, is put for the conſequent, or the cauſe for the effect;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:111412:68"/> a propriety of ſpeech very frequent in Scripture (as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon occaſion, we have taken notice of) His meaning in it is, that ſuch an one, <hi>viz. who love's father or mother, more then him,</hi> ſhall have no benefit by him, ſhall not be ſav'd by him. He expreſſeth this, by laying down a plain ground or reaſon for it; <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> in ſuch a perſon of him: <hi>i.</hi> the unſutableneſſe and incongruity that would be in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the equity or wiſedome of God in caſe God ſhould give of that ſalvation, which comes by me, to ſuch a man: In regard of which incongruity, moſt certain it is, that God will never do it. As on the contrary, when there is a <hi>worthineſſe, i.</hi> a meetneſſe or capacity, as it were, in a perſon to have any ſuch act of grace or favour as we now ſpeak of conferr'd upon him, God will in that reſpect conferre it accordingly. You have this paſſage from the mouth of our Saviour himſelf, now in glory, <hi>Rev 3. Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, which have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed their garments: i.</hi> they have walked anſwerable to their <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 4.</note> holy calling by the Goſpel, or profeſſion: <hi>theſe ſhall walk with me in white: i.</hi> ſhall be partakers with me in my glory, why? <hi>For they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are worthy: i.</hi> there is a <hi>decorum</hi> in it, there is a rationall proportion between ſuch mens waies, and ſuch a reward; not in reſpect of any exactneſſe or rigor in point of juſtice, or of merit; but in reſpect of the goodneſſe, wiſdome, and bounty of God; ſo that he may conferre the glory of ſalvation upon ſuch, without diſparagement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the eyes of his creature, either in goodneſſe, holineſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, he ſhall do it to the glory and high commendation of theſe: and becauſe he may reward upon ſuch terms, he will do it. We muſt not ſtand here to argue or reſolve that queſtion: Why are not wicked men, who <hi>defile their garments,</hi> as <hi>worthy</hi> of ſalvation, or, of walking with Chriſt in white, as they are of receiving grace, or the guift of converſion from God? And if God doth not ſtand upon worthineſſe in the one, but gives grace to the moſt unworthy of all, from day to day, why ſhould he ſtand upon it in the other? This queſtion we have heretofore (as I remember) given ſatisfaction unto; and may upon occaſion beſtow ſome further thoughts upon it hereafter: we ſhould digreſſe too farre to fall upon it for the preſent. By
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:111412:68"/> what hath been ſaid upon the Scripture cited from <hi>Matthew,</hi> it fully appears, that ſuch perſons as ſhall not deny themſelves in outward injoyments and contentments in the world, ſhall have no benefit by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently ſhall periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly: which is yet further confirmed by thoſe two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſes: <hi>And he that taketh not up his croſſe and followeth after me, is not worthy of me:</hi> And, <hi>he that will finde his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> We muſt not now inſiſt upon the particular opening of theſe; as neither of that other place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. which we joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the former: we ſhall do little upon it, ſave onely repeat the words unto you. <hi>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee; for it is profitable for thee, that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 29 30.</note> 
               <hi>one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be cast into hell.</hi> By the <hi>right hand,</hi> and <hi>right eye,</hi> our Saviour means, all manner of deſires, contentments, enjoyments whatſoever, chiefly thoſe that are moſt pleaſing and contentfull unto us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt. Now theſe are ſaid <hi>to offend us,</hi> or, to <hi>make us to offend</hi> (as the word ſignifies) when we are either apt to be tempted or occaſioned by them, to baulk any of the waies or precepts of Chriſt, or to walk contrary to them. And whereas he ſaith, that <hi>it is profitable for us that one of our members ſhould periſh, and not,</hi> &amp;c. He clearly implies, that the not plucking out the <hi>right eye,</hi> or not <hi>cutting off the right hand,</hi> when they <hi>offend us, i.</hi> the not denying of our ſelves in ſuch contentments, which we cannot enjoy without faultring with Chriſt in ſome or other of his waies, will certainly bring the vengeance of hell-fire upon us: So that cleer it is, that the Scriptures ſtrive and contend with the world, to bring men to that <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> we ſpake of, by this argument alſo of dread and terrour; <hi>viz.</hi> the threatning of them with hell-fire, if they will not ſubmit. This for the ſecond thing propounded: How, and after what manner, and by what means, the Scriptures bend themſelves to fill the world with the deniallof it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The third, and laſt thing we have to do, is to weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what there is, either in the nature of the deſigne we ſpeak
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:111412:69"/> of <hi>(viz</hi> in building up the world in a <hi>deniall of it ſelf)</hi> or elſe in the manner of the managing of it in the Scriptures (as it hath been repreſented unto you) or in both together, to evince theſe Scriptures to be from God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the very nature of the deſigne, bewrayeth God to be the authour of it, and conſequently, of the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and whereby it is managed and promoted. It is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <note place="margin">Act. 6. 15.</note> that they that <hi>ſat in the councell, looking ſtedfaſtly upon Stephen, ſaw his face as it had been the face of an Angel.</hi> There was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beauty or comelineſſe that appeared in it. And, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if we have eyes to ſee, and ſhall but narrowly and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly look upon that noble principle or diſpoſition of <hi>ſelf deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> which we ſpake of, with the pretious fruits and effects of it, in which it may be beſt diſcern'd and judged of, there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a kind of heavenly luſtre and brightneſſe in the face of it, whereby it may be diſcern'd and known to have ſomewhat more then <hi>fleſh and bloud</hi> in it; to be of a more worthy paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage then from men. For what is the deniall of a mans ſelf truly interpreted, but the making of a mans ſelf, and his own ends, his <hi>footſtool,</hi> and the glory of God, and good of other men, his <hi>throne?</hi> And by what way can we reaſonably imagine, that ever it ſhould enter into the heart of man (except it came thither by Gods ſpeciall ſending) to teach the world to build ſuch a <hi>throne</hi> as this? The great maſters and inſtructers of the world, led by the beſt genius and ſpirit which they had to attend and to inſpire them, ſought to plant the world with a quite contrary principle (upon the matter) and that under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a choice and excellent vertue (as we ſignified unto you, in our firſt argument of this ſecond head.) Here we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd you that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf amongſt ſome other of his vertues condemn'd for vices in the Scriptures, ſet's up that which he call's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> a kinde of magnificence and greatneſſe, or ſtatelineſſe of ſpirit, which teacheth a man to ſtand upon his termes: and if he be worthy of great things, to judge ſo of himſelf, and to let the world know it accordingly. Whereas the nature and property of that <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> frame of ſpirit which the Scripture commends (yea and commands, as we heard) unto the beſt and greateſt and moſt deſerving of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:111412:69"/> men, is to teach, and perſwade men, to forbear all reflecting upon their own goodneſſe and worth in every kinde; to take heed of ſetting their hearts upon their wiſedome, or vertuous actions when they increaſe; as well as upon <hi>riches</hi> when they <hi>increaſe.</hi> To be as men that know no excellencie or deſert in themſelves, no though God hath made their faces to ſhine, by making them eminent and ſignall benefactours unto the world; but to be as <hi>weaned children</hi> (in <hi>Davids</hi> metaphor) amongſt thoſe to whom they have been as <hi>fathers,</hi> and preſervers: to give the world leave to do what they pleaſe, even the worſt, unto them, when they have done the beſt they have been able, for the world: yea and to deſire no other recompence from the world, for all the good they have done for it, when they have done the uttermoſt they have been able, then onely an opportunity to doe them more ſtill; and to expect no other recompence from it, but ingratitude in the higheſt. The voice that teacheth theſe things unto the world, is certainly the voice of God, and not of men. Alas, the learning and wiſedome of the wiſe men of the world, never reach'd any ſuch notions, or ſtrains of true excellency as theſe: theſe things dwelt with God in that <hi>light which is unacceſſible</hi> unto men, untill himſelf was pleaſed to bring them forth into ſuch a light which is acceſſible.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, if we ſhall adde the conſideration of the means wherewith the Scriptures are furniſhed, and whereby they daily advance this work of <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> in the world, this character of their divinity, will appear more clearly. For certain it is, that whatſoever excellencie, or praiſe-worthy thing, of how neer affinity ſoever to which <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> indeed, the wiſedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and piety of this world, have at any time recommended unto, or endeavoured to advance amongſt men, they never had that outſtretched arme of means, nor any like unto it, to carry on their attempt, which the Scriptures have, to exalt that <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> in the hearts and ſoules and lives of men, which they have abundantly exalted in all theſe, againſt all the ſtrong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, the numerous and potent contradictions hereunto, which they have met with, and do meet with daily, from the moſt inveterate corruptions in the natures and cuſtomes, in the lives
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:111412:70"/> and waies of men. Never did <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Seneca,</hi> or any of that generation of men, who ſought to make the world wiſe without the <hi>wiſedome revealed from heaven</hi> in the Serip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ever lift up ſuch a motive to the hearts and ſouls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, ſo likely to transform them, to act, and work, and mould them into a ſelf-denying frame, as that moſt ſtrange and never-enough admired humiliation of the Sonne of God, in the deſcription and demonſtration whereof the Goſpel ſo much rejoiceth. Nor did any man, the eyes of whoſe ſoul were never bleſs't with the ſight or enterview of the Goſpel, ever ingage life and immortality, or the powers of the world to come, to teach men how to <hi>deny themſelves;</hi> eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms of advantage on which the Scriptures imploy them, for ſuch a purpoſe: nor did any man, eſpecially without the aid of the Scriptures, ever cauſe <hi>hell to riſe up from beneath,</hi> after any ſuch manner, with that emphaſis of dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which the Scripture doth to carry men upon the wings of fear over that great gulf, which lies between <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> to land them here. But this conſideration we have further opened and urged, in another argument, and therefore only give a taſt of it here. Howbeit the very mention of it, is ſufficient to dignifie, and diſtinguiſh the Scriptures from all writings whatſoever, whoſe authours are men, and not God.</p>
            <p>A fourth evidence or demonſtration, from the matter of the Scriptures, to prove their originall and deſcent from God is, that heart-ſearching properly, which is found in many of the veins and paſſages of it, that penetrating force and vigour which ever and anon, in the preaching and opening of them, it fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the reins and conſciences and inward parts of men. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the ſun, <hi>his going forth is from the end of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal 19. 6.</note> 
               <hi>heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</hi> So doe the Scriptures compaſſe the hearts and ſouls and conſciences of men round about, there is nothing in the inward parts of men, though never ſo ſecret or retired, and that is hid from the beams of the light of them. They are as mediatours to bring men and their hearts, men and their conſciences together; and to make them acquainted the one
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:111412:70"/> with the other, who before liv'd, as it were, at a diſtance, and had little knowledge the one of the other. <hi>There is not a word in my tongue</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but loe, O Lord, thou knoweſt it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 4.</note> 
               <hi>all together, viz.</hi> whilſt it is yet <hi>in my tongue,</hi> and before it be uttered. So experience ſhews, that there is not a word, not a thought, not a purpoſe or intention in the heart or ſoul of a man, but the Scripture knows it altogether, even whilſt it is yet ſecret; whilſt it doth but work in the very conception and firſt gathering or riſing of it, before either it be perfectly form'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or put into outward act or execution, the Scripture takes hold of it, the very fountains of the great depths in men are many times as it were broken up by it; and the foundations of the round world in the ſouls of men diſcovered. The hidden treaſures of darkneſſe are brought forth into light; and men come to ſee the inviſible things of their own ſpirits by it.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures themſelves ſpeak much of that property of theirs which we are now holding forth unto you, as a proof, that they are from God: but becauſe it is their own cauſe that is in pleading, we ſhall not inſiſt upon their teſtimony in this kinde, ſave onely ſo farre, as the frequent and ſenſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of men and work concurre with it, and ſo are a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to it.</p>
            <p>Now the Scriptures may be ſaid to ſearch, or to diſcover the hearts of men, two waies, or in two reſpects. 1. As they declare and ſhew unto men, ſuch things in them, as they took notice of, and knew to be in themſelves, before ſuch declaration was made unto them, but were not aware that any other took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, but themſelves; thought them ſecrets, into which no ſoul had entred but their own. 2. As they diſcloſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto men ſuch things in them, which they never knew before to be in them, which they never minded in themſelves, untill the diſcoveries we ſpeak of came upon them.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, There are many things in the hearts and ſpirits of men, which doe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> flote and ſwim as it were in the top of the waters, which are nigh unto themſelves, and with which they themſelves converſe familiarly from time to time; but yet they little think or conſider that any other hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with them in the knowledge hereof. Thus many are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:111412:71"/> conſcious to themſelves of ſuch and ſuch fears under which they live, leaſt ſuch or ſuch wicked and foul practiſes of theirs, as in waies of adultery, cheating, coining and the like, ſhould break out and be diſcovered, and come to the publike knowledge of men. So again, many know well enough that ſuch and ſuch purpoſes and intentions lodge in them; yea and that ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and diſpoſitions work in their members (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles phraſe is) Now then, this is that which I ſay, that the Scriptures many times, eſpecially in the miniſtry and opening of them, meet with theſe ſecret and hidden things of the ſoul; challenge men and women for them, and charge them with them; deſcribing them with ſo much particularity and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo neer to the life, that men cannot lightly but think, that either he that preſents and ſhews them unto them upon ſuch terms, hath been within them, and ſeen the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were, face to face; or that he that ſets them on work, and directs them to ſpeak, hath had that advantage. The Scriptures ſpeak of ſuch things as theſe, ſuch diſcoveries as we ſpeak of, as things very agreeable to them, and which may well come to paſſe by their miniſtry. <hi>But if all prophecie</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all, viz.</hi> of all that <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 24.</note> propheſie at ſuch a time: he is <hi>convinc'd</hi> of them, and <hi>judg'd</hi> of them; <hi>i.</hi> it may come to paſſe, that he may be <hi>convinc'd</hi> and <hi>judg'd</hi> of them. There is that in the nature of <hi>prophecying,</hi> or of opening the Scriptures, which is apt to convince and judge men. It is a property of ſpeech very frequent in Scripture, to ſignifie the aptneſſe of a means for the doing of ſuch or ſuch a thing, or producing ſuch or ſuch an effect, by mentioning the effect, as produced by it, whether it be really and actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or no, ſee 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 11. Gen. 20. 3. And thus are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> How, or to whom, are the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of ſuch a mans <hi>heart made manifeſt,</hi> by means of that <hi>prophecying,</hi> or opening the Scriptures here ſpoken of? It ſeems not ſo much to others, no, nor to him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who prophecieth; but rather to the man himſelf, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the effect or conſequent of this manifeſtation, in thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:111412:71"/> words: <hi>and ſo falling down on his face,</hi> ſo, <hi>i.</hi> by reaſon of the ſecrets of his <hi>heart manifeſted,</hi> he will <hi>fall down on his face and worſhip God:</hi> though by this effect of the diſcovery made to himſelf, they are in part made manifeſt unto others alſo. But if the <hi>ſecrets of the mans heart</hi> here ſpoken of, be ſuch things as were known unto him before, how can they be ſaid to be made <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto him, by hearing the <hi>Church propheſie?</hi> I anſwer, they may in a five-fold ſence or conſideration, be ſaid to be made <hi>manifeſt</hi> to him by the means here ſpoken of, though they were known unto him before.</p>

Though in reſpect of their nature or ſimple being they were known to a man before, yet in reſpect of their firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and ſource, from whence they came, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods heavy curſe upon mankinde in the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> for ſin: and in this reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> which concern's the ſhamefull and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pedegree of them, they may be ſaid to be made manifeſt unto him by propheſying according to the Scriptures, And the truth is, that ſin, and things that are ſinfull, can never be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt (in the emphaticall ſence of the word) <hi>i.</hi> fully manifeſt, unleſſe it be known what, or who, was the authour or firſt founder of the generation. This diſcovery or manifeſtation of ſinne, cannot be made unto any man, by any other way, light, or means, but onely by the Scriptures. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the ſecrets of the heart of the man of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, might (as was ſaid) be known unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in reſpect of their ſimple being; yet in reſpect of their ſinfulneſſe, or the evil cleaving to them, they might be unknown to him (or however very darkly and obſcurely known) men may know that ſuch and ſuch deſires, and ſo that ſuch and ſuch diſpoſitions, ſuch and ſuch apprehenſions, and imaginations are in them; and yet be ignorant that theſe deſires, diſpoſitions, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations which they know are in them, are ſo wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable in the ſight of God, as the Scriptures repreſents them. It is one thing for a man when he hath vowed a vow unto God, and not paid it, to know that he hath not paid it, and another thing to know, cleerly how ſinfull he is before God for not paying of it. It is one thing for a man to know, that he was at maſſe, or did reverence to the hoſt; another thing to know
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111412:72"/> that he ſinn'd in doing either. The Papiſts generally know, when they are at maſſe, that they are at it; but they do not know that they do evil in being there: So naturall and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, may know that ſuch and ſuch deſires, as (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) of ſuch things as are another mans, and diſpoſitions, as to uncleanneſſe, fornication, revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in them; and yet not know that they are hatefull in the ſight of God. Now then, when the Scriptures in the miniſtry of them, diſcover the evil and vileneſſe of ſuch things, they may very properly be ſaid to make them manifeſt, and that in ſpeciall manner to the perſons themſelves, in whom they are; becauſe the diſcovery or reproof of particular ſinnes by the Scriptures, doe nothing in that degree affect or ſmite the conſciences of thoſe that are free, as they doe of thoſe that know themſelves guilty of them. And the truth is, that things which are evil and ſinnefull, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver manifeſt unto men. <hi>i.</hi> in any meaſure known, as they are to be known, and as they ſhould be known, till the Scriptures hath had to do with the judgements and conſciences of men, and work about them; till they have repreſented them unto men by their light. Hence you have the expreſſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 5. But all things that are reproved, are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the light;</hi> or rather (according to the former treatiſe which is much better, here) <hi>But all things when they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the light</hi> (meaning of the Scriptures, or that light which <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 13.</note> ſhines from them) <hi>are made manifeſt, for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light. q. d.</hi> As it is the nature and property of the naturall light, to diſcover and manifeſt all things, <hi>i.</hi> all viſible and corporeall things, where it ſhines, without which their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhapes and forms and colours could not be ſeen or known: in like manner, all things that are ſpeciall, and which relate to another world, cannot be manifeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> to the judgements and conſciences of men, neither in the evil of them, if they be things that be evil; nor yet in the goodneſſe of them, if they be things that are truly good, but onely by the Scriptures, or the light that ſhines from them.</p>
            <p>Well then, this is another conſideration, in which ſuch ſecrets of the hearts of men, which were in reſpect of their beings known before, may yet be ſaid to be made manifeſt unto them
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:111412:72"/> by that Scripture exerciſe of prophecving.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is another manifeſtation of the things we ſpeak of, which uſually follows upon the two former, as the effect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of them, eſpecially of the latter: and this is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of them in their proper tendency, which is unto death, and the everlaſting deſtruction of the creature, with whom they are found, if they be things that are evil; whereas on the contrary, the proper tendencie of things that are good, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life and glory; and theſe alſo are <hi>made manifest</hi> in this their bleſſed tendencie by the Scriptures. Men may know that they have ſuch and ſuch deſires and diſpoſitions, ſuch and ſuch ends and intentions within them, and may yet further know, that they are ſinnefully evil; and yet not neceſſarily know that they binde men over (and that with adamantine bands that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken, but by the hand of faith in Chriſt Jeſus) unto eternall condemnation, and the vengeance of eternall fire. But the Scriptures when they <hi>make</hi> them <hi>manifeſt</hi> in the two former conſiderations, uſually make them manifeſt in this alſo. <hi>I was once alive</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) without the law, but when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> reviv'd but I died.</hi> When the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7 9.</note> 
               <hi>came, viz.</hi> to my conſcience, in the light and power of it, diſcovering firſt unto me the great evil of my ſinne: ſecondly, the heavy condemnation which in that regard attended it; <hi>ſinne reviv'd, i</hi> that evil principle within me, the malignity of my nature, began to work at an higher rate of wickedneſſe then before, cauſing me to think harder thoughts of God, and of his law then I did before, and ſtrongly tempting me to be deſperate in ſinning, ſince all hope of mercy was cut off from me. <hi>But I died, i.</hi> I gave my ſelf for a childe of perdition, for a loſt man. This is a third manifeſtation, which the Scriptures make of the ſinfull ſecrets of the hearts of men. There is yet another conſideration</p>
            <p>(In the fourth place) wherein they may be ſaid to make them manifeſt too; which reſults as it were from all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This you may conceive thus. The ſecrets of the hearts of carnall and ſinfull men, being ſo diſcovered unto them (as you have heard) in the three former conſiderations in their originall vileneſſe, and guilt, muſt needs become ſo much the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:111412:73"/> more a deformed, ghaſtly, and formidable object, in the eye of their conſciences; which appearance anſwers the reality and truth of them; for things that are ſinfull, are out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, deformed, ghaſtly, formidable; and when they come to be ſo apprehended and look'd upon, then are they <hi>manifeſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto them who ſo judge of them: and ſo much the more <hi>manifeſt,</hi> by how much the more frequently and attentively men ſhall thus look upon them. Now when the Scriptures have put their colours upon the things that are ſinfull in men, and made them to appear in their eyes like unto themſelves, <hi>i.</hi> monſtrous, ghaſtly, and formidable (as was ſaid) the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo much the more provoked and ingag'd to look both frequently and attentively upon them, and cannot lightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear either the one or the other. This is a fourth ſence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, wherein the <hi>ſecrets of mens hearts</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>made manifest</hi> unto them, by the Scriptures preached.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, there is yet another ſence, wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may be underſtood, and the <hi>ſecrets of mens hearts</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>made manifeſt</hi> unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are cleerly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and held forth unto them in the Scriptures, being opened and laid before them, as a mans naturall face may be ſaid to be made <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto him, when ſuch a glaſſe is preſented to him, and held before his eies, wherein all the lineaments and true proportion of this face of his appears. And though it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a man had ſome knowledge of his face, as what manner of one it is, before the glaſſe be preſented to him; yet this face of his may truly and properly enough be ſaid, to be made <hi>manifeſt, i</hi> cleerly ſhewn unto him in the glaſſe. In like manner, though it be ſuppoſed, that naturall men know the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their hearts</hi> before they come at the Scriptures; yet this diſplaying, and deſcribing them before their faces, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry properly be ſaid to <hi>make them manifest</hi> unto them. Now there is no man or woman who converſeth much, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, and conſcientiouſly with the Scriptures, eſpecially that lives under, or frequents a lively and powerfull miniſtry of them, but he experimentally finds, and cannot but give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the truth of what hath been ſaid in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars inſiſted upon, concerning the property which we have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:111412:73"/> aſſerted unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>ſearching the hearts and the reins</hi> of the ſons and daughters of men. As the King of <hi>Arams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant told her maſter, that the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> made <hi>known to the King of Iſrael even the Words that he ſpake in his privy chamber:</hi> So doe the Scriptures ever and anon tell men and women in <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 12.</note> their ear, the words they ſpeak in the ſecret chambers of their hearts; they diſcover unto them, their moſt private and retired thoughts, their counſels, the particular motions, debates and agitations of their ſpirits, in reference to ſuch or ſuch a buſineſſe, or the committing of ſuch or ſuch a ſinne; what hath paſs'd, and hath been argued <hi>pro &amp; contrà</hi> within them. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto them the figleaves, which they ſew together to cover their nakedneſſe; I mean the fleſhly and fooliſh argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reaſons and grounds, by which they ſtrengthen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves, in waies and practiſes of looſeneſſe, vanity, and ſinne. They declare unto drunkards, and vain-company keepers, upon what grounds they build their drunken practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and ſo to the adulterer, and unclean perſon, what their hope and confidence is of coming off at laſt without danger from the waies of that abomination: and ſo to the covetous perſon, and thoſe that practiſe deceipt, they unboſome theſe alſo to themſelves; and lay before them thoſe ſnares of death wherein their feet are taken; I mean thoſe carnall reaſonings and conceits, which are the oracles they conſult with, for the comforting of them in their way.</p>
            <p>Let me adde this one thing further under this firſt head: look what hath been ſpoken to illuſtrate and confirm the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching property of the Scriptures, in reſpect of things that are evil in men; as much is to be conceived, and might readily be ſpoken on the otherhand, I mean to illuſtrate and prove the like divine faculty or property in them, to diſcover and atteſt all things that are juſt, and holy, and good in the hearts and ſpirits of good men. They declare and ſhew their hearts alſo unto them, with all the goodneſſe, beauty, and excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, that the holy Ghoſt hath wrought upon them; they preſent them ever and anon with a modell and draught, of that uprightneſſe and ſincerity, of thoſe holy affections and deſires, thoſe gracious purpoſes intentions and reſolutions,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:111412:74"/> thoſe ſpirituall and ſubſtantiall reaſonings and debates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh themſelves in the waies of life and peace. And this for the firſt of the two waies mentioned, wherein the Scriptures may be ſaid to ſearch and diſcover the hearts of men; <hi>viz.</hi> as touching ſuch things, which are already known in part unto men themſelves, when they come to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Scriptures have a more ſearching and piercing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then ſo, into the hearts and ſpirits of men. They doe not onely ſearch out and deſcrie ſuch <hi>ſecret</hi> things in men, which ſwim upon the face of the waters, and lye in the uppermoſt parts of the ſoul, being known [in part] unto the hearts of men themſelves; but they dive to the bottome, and draw out even the deep waters of the ſoul; ſuch as the ſoul it ſelf was not aware of, knew not of their being there; they declare what is below, even in the nethermoſt parts of the earth. <hi>Who knoweth the things of a man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi> Yea, the <hi>ſpirit of man which is in him,</hi> knows <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> but in part the things of the man. <hi>Hazael</hi> knew not there was any ſuch diſpoſition or principle in him, which would carrie him to commit thoſe barbarous and bloudy ſinnes, mentioned 2 <hi>King. 8</hi> as the <hi>ſetting of ſtrong Cities on fire, ſlaying young</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 King. 8. 13.</note> 
               <hi>men with the ſword, daſtuing infants againſt the ſtones,</hi> tearing in pieces, or <hi>ripping up women with childe;</hi> nay he was ſo far from being conſcious unto himſelf of any ſuch diſpoſition as this within him, that when the Prophet charg'd him with it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with great diſdain: <hi>What? is thy ſervant a dog, that I ſhould doe this great</hi> [or ſtrange] <hi>thing?</hi> He thought he was as far from doing ſuch things as theſe, as he was from being turned into a <hi>dog.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh. 3. If our heart condemn us, God <note place="margin">1. Joh. 3. 20.</note> is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things:</hi> clearly impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that our hearts, <hi>i.</hi> conſciences and underſtandings, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defective in knowing and comprehending thoſe things in us, that are juſt matter of condemnation to us: And that in caſe we have not the teſtimony of our conſciences, that our atonement is made by Jeſus Chriſt; we have cauſe to fear and to expect a proportion of wrath and vengeance from God, for much more ſinne and wickedneſſe, then we know by our ſelves. <hi>Yea the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:111412:74"/> things of a man, which the ſpirit that is in him,</hi> knows of, hold no conſiderable proportion with thoſe things of the man, that are in him, whereof this ſpirit is ignorant: as the fiſhes of the ſea which are taken and drawn out of the waters, are not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand part for number, of thoſe that are left behind. <hi>Therein</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>great and wide ſea) are things creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innumerable, both great and ſmall beaſts.</hi> So like wiſe it is in that great element, that vaſt treaſure-houſe of the heart and ſpirit of man: there are thoughts, affections, diſpoſitions, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with other furniture of that kinde without number, of a thouſand ſhapes and ſorts, the leaſt portion or part whereof it is, that ever comes to the knowledge of the heart and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of men, except it be by the mediation of ſuch diſcoveries, as are made by the light of the Scriptures unto them. For God (as we heard even now from <hi>John)</hi> is not onely <hi>greater then our hearts (viz.</hi> in knowing what is in us) but is ſo far <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as that he <hi>knows all things</hi> in this kinde, our hearts <hi>(i.</hi> our conſciences, as was ſaid) knowing little in compariſon. Now look what knowledge of the hearts and ſpirits of men, is in God, is likewiſe in the Scriptures; for God hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this knowledge unto them. Look whatſoever God himſelf knows concerning the generall frame and temper of the hearts and natures of men and women, he hath transfuſed and wrought it into the body of the Scriptures. So that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. whatſoever is knowable of the evil or wickedneſſe of the heart of man (in generall) and ſo likewiſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof too, when it is regenerate, is to be found in the Scriptures, if we were able to ſearch the treaſurie hereof. This great truth ſeems to lye in the joynt of thoſe two verſes, verſ. 12. and 13. of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Hebr. For the word of God is lively, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12. cam 13.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Neither is there any creature which is not manifeſt</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>in his ſight: but all things are naked and open</hi> &amp;c. q. d. <hi>The word of God is</hi> (and muſt needs be) thus <hi>lively in operation,</hi> &amp;c.—becauſe God hath the perfect and through knowledge of all things whatſoever in the hearts of men; and hath levened (as it were) and ſeaſoned the Scriptures (his word) with this knowledge. He ſeem'd to take meaſure of the heart of man, when he fram'd his word, they are ſo commenſurable the one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:111412:75"/> unto the other, in that reſpect. There is no man or woman that have had any intimate and conſciencious doings with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but know by their own experience, that theſe things are ſo: I mean that the Scriptures do not onely declare unto them ſuch things, as they themſelves know to be in them, when the declaration is made; but that they propheſie alſo of many other things, which they knew not of, and could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve were in them indeed, which yet do appear from within, and diſcover themſelves in their ſeaſon; as the diſpoſition in <hi>Hazael</hi> which we ſpake of, did, when the tentation came in his way, and he made King of <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now briefly conſider, whether there be not weight and power in abundance in the conſideration now propoſed and opened unto you, to exalt the concluſion on high, in your judgements and conſciences, which we drive at: <hi>viz</hi> that the Scriptures are the offspring and iſſue of God. <hi>When I conſider</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking in his meditation unto God) <hi>thy heavens</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the work of thy fingers, the moon and the ſtarres which thou haſt ordeined, what is man,</hi>—&amp;c. <hi>David</hi> (we ſee) calls the <hi>Heavens,</hi> Gods <hi>Heavens (when I conſider thy heavens)</hi> and the <hi>work</hi> of his <hi>fingers;</hi> and one thing (it ſeems) which made him ſo poſitive in his concluſion, that the <hi>heavens</hi> were Gods, <hi>i. the work of his fingers,</hi> was the conſideration of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous furniture of them, the <hi>moon and the ſtarres;</hi> theſe (it ſeems) gave light in the eyes of <hi>Davids</hi> judgement and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to ſee and judge that God was the workman and maker of them. But certainly <hi>the moon</hi> and all <hi>the ſtarres</hi> in the firmament of heaven (take the ſun himſelf into the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) doe not give any ſuch light whereby to be led unto God, as the architect and makes of them, to diſcover him in this relation unto them, as thoſe characters and impreſſions of light in the Scriptures, which anſwer with ſo much exactnes the ſecret &amp; hidden impreſſions of things in the hearts and ſpirits of men and women in the world, doe demonſtrate theſe to be a fabrick of wiſedome and knowledge, whoſe builder and maker muſt needs be God. Some that have been diligent obſervers of the <hi>ſun, moon and ſtarres,</hi> have yet doubted whether God was the maker of them, and have rather thought that they were from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:111412:75"/> eternity: Yea ſome that have minded them narrowly, have doubted whether there be a God or no, yea denied it, as <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> with ſome others of old. But (doubtleſſe) never did any man, who in any conſiderable degree, underſtood and minded thoſe ſtrains and carriages in the Scriptures, which comprehend the darkneſſe, and open the hid treaſures of the hearts and ſpirits of men, doubt or queſtion, whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were from God or no. <hi>And thus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> as we heard before, ſpeaking of the unbeliever that ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and hear the Saints propheſying) <hi>Thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25.</note> 
               <hi>he will worſhip God, and report, that God is in you of a truth.</hi> The diſcovery <hi>of the ſecrets of the heart,</hi> even nature it ſelf teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to acknowledge and reſent, as that which is above the ſphere of the creature, and proper unto God. <hi>Come ſee a man</hi> (ſaith the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to her countrymen) <hi>that hath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh 4. 29.</note> 
               <hi>told me all things that ever I did? Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to be able to tell things that are ſecret, argues ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all communion with a ſupernaturall principle, which is God. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. when Chriſt had ſaid unto her; <hi>thou haſt had five</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> 
               <hi>huſbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy huſband;</hi> ſhe preſently concluded, that he was <hi>a Prophet. The woman ſaith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a Prophet:</hi> meaning, that he had the knowledge of ſuch things as he declared, imparted unto him by God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 24. God is ſaid to be <hi>the knower of the hearts of all men:</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> dated from heaven, aſſumes this unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his prerogative royall, to be he which <hi>ſearcheth the reins and the heart;</hi> and declares that he will cauſe <hi>all the Churches to know it. And I will kill her children with death</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a falſe <hi>Propheteſſe) and all the Churches ſhall know, that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and the heart. I am he which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 1. 24. Rev. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>ſearcheth,</hi> &amp;c. Implying that he alone, and no other, is inveſted with this glorious priviledge of <hi>ſearching the reins and the heart.</hi> So then this being a principle of truth written as it were by the hand of nature in the tables of every mans heart, of every mans conſcience, that to diſcover the ſecrets of the hearts of men is the proper character of God, and the Scriptures having
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:111412:76"/> this character ſo plainly, richly and viſibly ſtampt upon them; evident it is, that their originall and deſcent is from God.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; but may not men, eſpecially lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wiſe and acute men, partly by obſerving the motions, waies and turnings of their own hearts, partly, by obſerving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, humours, intereſts and ends of others in the world, and partly by holding intelligence and an intimacy of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with men of wiſedome and underſtanding like themſelves, and ſo ever and anon comparing, as it were, notes together; be able to ſay as much as is to be found in the Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecrets of the hearts and ſpirits of men? To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conceſſion; that ſuch men as the objection ſpeaks of, may ſay much upon the advantages mentioned, concerning the inward frame, the ſecret actings, and turnings, and windings of the hearts of men: they may diſcover abundance even of the deep things of men: and goe farre in ſearching the hidden treaſury of their hearts and ſpirits. And the truth is that many of them have done much in this kinde. But</p>
            <p n="2">2.

The plough of the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, makes a deep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and turns up more of the earth and ſoil of the heart from beneath, then the Philoſophers plough doth: yea it brings up ſuch things, which the other never touched, or came neer. The <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> having neither themſelves the grace of the Goſpel, and the great things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> tendered unto them, nor yet any of thoſe, with whom they had acquaintance; and wanting the experience of the behaviours, carriages, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of men cloſely purſued, urg'd and preſſed by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the holy commands, and terrible threatnings thereof, as

This was the effect of that propheſie concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>Simeon</hi> uttered, <hi>Luk. 2. 34. And Simeon bleſſed them, and ſaid unto Mary his Mother, Behold this childe is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael: and for a ſigne which ſhall be ſpoken againſt—that the thoughts of many hearts might be revealed;</hi> implying, that Chriſt being effectually preach'd in the miniſtry of the Goſpel in the world, will be a means to reveal and diſcover more of the hearts and inward parts of men, then ever would have come to light, or have been taken knowledge of otherwiſe; and that this was one of the deſignes or intentions of God, in ſending Chriſt upon ſuch terms as he did, into the world. Now certain it is, that there is no kinde of thought or imagination, no motion, ſtrein, or turning in the hearts of men, that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtirr'd up within only, or externally drawn forth upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by means of the Goſpel, but that there is ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mention, or diſcovery of it, in the Goſpel it ſelf. <hi>For the word of God is quick and powerfull</hi> (as we heard before from <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12</note> the Apoſtle, upon a like occaſion) <hi>and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner, of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> Now the knowing or <hi>diſcovering of the intents of the heart, i.</hi> of all the ends and propoſalls which the heart conceiveth and projecteth in it ſelf, is the higheſt pitch, and utmoſt period of whatſoever can be known concerning the <hi>heart</hi> of man.</p>

So then, the Apoſtle ſaying, that <hi>the ſpirituall man judgeth,</hi> or trieth, <hi>every man; but himſelf is tried of no man viz.</hi> but of ſuch as himſelf: for he ſpeaks here of the whole ſpecies or kinde of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> men, though he uſeth the ſingular number (a thing uſuall in Scripture) his meaning is cleerly this; that ſuch men as are <hi>spirituall,</hi> any thing well grown in grace, and in the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the Scriptures, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, underſtand, and are able to diſcourſe, and ſpeak of the inward condition of all ſorts of men, they know how it is with the hearts and ſpirits of meer naturall men, what their thoughts, counſels, and inclinations are (in the generall) ſo likewiſe they know the ſtate and condition of young and weak Chriſtians, that are yet but <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> how it is with them, in the way of their hearts and ſpirits; and ſo alſo they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how it is with men that are <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

This is one advantage, or means they have to <hi>judge of every man.</hi> The other, is the knowledge which they have of the Scriptures, and of the word of God, which aſſiſting their foreſaid experience of the eſtates of all men,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:111412:78"/> and concurring with it in that reſpect, muſt needs adde much unto them in this kinde, and make them very able to <hi>judge of every man.</hi> But <hi>he himſelf is judged of no man. i.</hi> of no other ſort of men, but his own, and ſuch as himſelf (as was ſaid) his heart and the waies thereof, his thoughts, counſels, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, intentions, diſpoſitions, deſires, hopes, fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be known or comprehended by any, but <hi>ſpirituall</hi> men.

So then moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the Scriptures, in as much as they <hi>judge ſpirituall</hi> men, as well as others, <hi>i.</hi> relate the heavenly ſtory of their hearts and ſpirits from the firſt to the laſt, could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or fram'd by any, but either by men who were <hi>spirituall</hi> themſelves, or elſe by God himſelf. Now to ſay that <hi>ſpirituall</hi> men compoſed them, it being an eſſentiall character or property of a <hi>spirituall</hi> man, not to publiſh or put forth any thing into the world, in the name of God, or as from him, which he knows to be onely from himſelf, and not from God; this being, in effect to make himſelf God; which is a deep abhorring to a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſoul. And beſides, <hi>spiritualneſſe</hi> in men being, as it were, an extract, or expreſſe of the divine nature, a fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, of the light and holineſſe which is in him, though it ſhould be granted that the Scriptures were made and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſuch men as theſe, yet will it follow, that the originall of them, eſpecially of all that which concerns the caſe and condition of a <hi>spirituall</hi> man, is from God. This for anſwer to the objection propounded: and for this fourth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>A 5. Demonſtration of the ſame concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures are from God, drawn from the matter of them;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:111412:79"/> is, that glorious and mighty power which ſometimes utters and expreſſeth it ſelf, out of ſome of the veins and paſſages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in comforting, raiſing, filling and lifting up the hearts of men. The world now for many generations together, hath had a full experiment of this great power we ſpeak of, breaking out of the Scriptures in the miniſtry of them, like fire or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the cloud, by which their hearts and ſouls have been reviv'd, quickned, and rais'd, as it were, from the dead: yea and ſometimes taken up into the heavens. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that our own ears have heard, and that ſome of our fathers, yea and ſome of our children, and many of our friends have told us, many of theſe <hi>magnalia,</hi> theſe great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works of the Scriptures in them, and upon them; how they have at ſuch a time been ſtrangely lightned and eaſed in their ſpirits, at another time, gloriouſly ſtrengthned in the inner man; at another, fill'd with joy in beleeving: at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they came in ſackcloth to hear, that by the hand of the Goſpel their ſackcloth was taken off from them, and they girded with joy and gladneſſe before their departure; when they came in darkneſſe, and with the ſhadow of death ſpread round about them, that the light of life ſhone unto them, and ſcattered that darkneſſe. Yea I make no queſtion but many of you that hear me this day, have in the Scriptures, <hi>taſted of the powers of the life to come;</hi> and felt your ſouls, as it were, bound up in the wings of the Goſpel, as if they had been ready to have been carried up into heaven immediately; that you have felt the iron bands and fetters of your fears and doubts looſed by the hand of the Goſpel, and falling from you; that upon the ſuddain <hi>turning</hi> of <hi>the captivity</hi> of your ſouls, you have been <hi>as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I found nothing but carnality in my ſelf, when the ſpirituallneſſe of the law appeared unto me: I thought I had ſtood upon a ſure bottome, had built upon a good foundation, untill the law cauſed me to ſee that I was in the midſt of death, and that there was but a ſtep between me and the bottomleſſe pit. Now (my brethren) let me ask you; doe not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when they are effectually preached in the world, ever and anon work after the ſame manner, in the hearts and ſouls of men? are not <hi>the mighty thrown down from the ſeats</hi> and thrones of their confidence by it? is not the ſecurity of many turn'd into fear and horrour by it? are not the conſciences of many made to burn by it, as if they were ſet on fire of hell?
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:111412:82"/> are not the ſouls of many made to dwell among lions by it, amongſt devouring terrours, and conſternations? How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent are caſes and complaints of trouble of conſcience, and diſtreſſe of ſoul of men and women, brought even to their wits ends, amongſt us, and that generally occaſioned, or begotten by the Scriptures. I know you are not the onely ſtrangers of the world, to be ignorant of theſe things. If you have not born any of theſe burthens your ſelves, I doubt not but you have been partakers with, and helpers unto others in the bearing of them.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee that the Scriptures have a ſpirit of power attending on them, working in them and by them, very great and terrible effects in the inner parts, and that rules the ſouls and conſciences of men, as it were with a rod of iron. Let us now conſider in a word, what there is in this conſideration alſo, to argue their deſcent from God. <hi>Haſt thou an arme like God?</hi> (ſaith God himſelf to <hi>Job,</hi> arguing with him) <hi>or canſt</hi>

The voice of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is powerfull: the voice of the Lord is full of majesty: The voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars: yea the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> The Hebrews call thunder, the voice, or mighty voices of God. <hi>Pray unto the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 29 4, 5.</note> unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron) (for it is enough) that there be no more voices of God</hi> (ſaith the originall) i. <hi>no more thunder.</hi> Thunder is call'd the voice of God, becauſe it is ſo majeſtique and full of power and terrour; and hath an influence of awe and dread upon the mindes and ſpirits of men: <hi>humanas mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a tonitrua mentes:</hi> the thunders which move or ſhake the <note place="margin">Ovid Met.</note> mindes or hearts of men: Now certainly to thunder in the ſpirits and conſciences of men and women, as the Scriptures ever and anon are wont to doe, to make ſuch terrible commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and concuſſions there, as are from time to time made, to fill the ſoul with aſtoniſhment, as if <hi>hell</hi> were <hi>riſen up from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,</hi> and all the powers of darkneſſe gotten into it, cannot but argue a power adequate to that which cauſeth it to thunder in the clouds of heaven. It is true in a ſenſe (I mean in that ſenſe, in which the Scripture affirmeth it) when time was, that God was neither <hi>in the tempeſt that rent the mountains, and brake

For let me ask, who ſhould doe it beſides? From whence ſhould thoſe grievous agonies and conflicts of ſoul, ſo grievous above meaſure, as ſometimes they are, even unto deſpair of ſalvation, ariſe, but from God? If it be anſwered and ſaid, that the devil may tempt men to deſpair, he may caſt in his fiery darts, and make them ſtick in the ſouls and conſciences of men; there they may remain eating, and burning in the ſoul, and cauſe extremity of pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: It's true, the devil hath a power to tempt men and women to deſpair; he hath <hi>fiery darts,</hi> and a naturall skill, ſo to throw them, as to faſten, and make them ſtick in the ſouls and conſciences of men; <hi>i.</hi> ſuddainly to inject or raiſe ſuch thoughts or apprehenſions in men, which have a tendencie in them to perſwade, or move men to deſpair. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. God keeps a bridle in the lips of this power of his; he cannot uſe it when he pleaſeth: for then (the Saints eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſhould never be free from this tentation to deſpair. But now and then upon ſome ſpeciall occaſion God ſlips the bridle for a while, and then Satan is at liberty; yet ſo, that even under this liberty permitted to him, the Saints, if they will keep their watch and guard ſtrong, may make reſiſtance. <hi>Reſiſt the devil</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4 7</note> (ſaith <hi>James) and he will flee from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though God gives the devil liberty to tempt in that kinde we ſpeak of, yea though men doe not make that reſiſtance which they both might, and ought, againſt his tentations, yet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:111412:83"/> except God gives up the ſouls and conſciences of men into his hand to be tempted by him, I mean ſo be tempted, as to be overcome, or to ſuffer from the tentation, nothing the devil can doe by way of tempting men, will faſten upon them, or much anoy them. It is the bleſſed priviledge of the creature, to be ſtill held and kept by the gracious and mighty hand of God, out of the reach of all evil, at leaſt of all evil, in any conſiderable degree prejudiciall to the comfort and peace of it, as well that which is ſinfull, as that which is penall, except onely in ſuch caſes, and upon ſuch occaſions, when God hath ſome ſpeciall deſigne, either for his own glory, or the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures good, or both, in letting goe this hold, and ſo deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his creature unto either. Ye have this expreſſion twice, <hi>Rom. 1. God gave them upto uncleanneſſe:</hi> and again, <hi>God gave</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 26.</note> 
               <hi>them up unto vile affections,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that theſe vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, though they were in men all the while, yet they had no power over them, to carry them forth, into vile actions and practiſes, till God let goe his hold of the men, and ſo deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up, as it were, into the hand of theſe affections, that they might doe with them even what they liſt. And <hi>Pſal</hi> 78. we have the like from <hi>David. He gave up their cattell alſo to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78 48.</note> 
               <hi>hail, and their flocks to hot thunder-bolts:</hi> implying, that the hail might have fallen, yea and upon the cattell too (and ſo the thunder-bolts) without doing them any harm, except God had let goe the hold which he had on them before, and ſo leaving them naked of their wonted they became a ſpoil to the hail and thunder. That likewiſe in <hi>Iſa</hi> 42. is of the ſame kinde (to omit many others) <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robbers?</hi> implying, that all the <hi>ſpoilers</hi> and <note place="margin">Iſa 42. 24.</note> 
               <hi>robbers</hi> in the world, could not have made a prey or ſpoil of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had not the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> put them, as it were, out of his own hand into theirs. Thus is it in the matter of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Satan upon permiſſion, may tempt men, as he did the Lord Chriſt himſelf: yea temptations may fall thick upon the ſoul; and yet the ſoul ſuffer no great anoiance from them, or loſſe in the things of the peace and comfort of it, unleſſe god deliver it up, and leave it in the hand of theſe tentations. So that ſtill whatſoever the devil doth, or whatſoever temptations
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:111412:84"/> doe, in cauſing trouble and perplexity in the ſouls of men, God is in the trouble and perplexity, as well as either of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me adde this further; that as no man can be tempted by Satan or by any temptations whatſoever, to the diſturbance or wounding of his ſoul or ſpirit, except God delivers him out of his own hand of ſafety into their hand of danger and evil; ſo neither can any man be tempted by either, to any further degree of inconvenience or trouble, then according to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree wherein God is pleaſed to take off his hand of protection from him. Gods hand of protection was taken off from <hi>Iob,</hi> in reſpect of his children, his cattell, his eſtate, his health; and thus farre the devil was able to advance his temptation, he did afflict <hi>Iob</hi> with the loſſe and deprivation of all theſe: but God keeping his hand ſtill upon <hi>Iobs</hi> life, the devil could not by any engine or means he could make, reach this. So is it likewiſe, in ſpirituall and inward temptations in the ſoul: look to what degree the ſoul is naked before him, he is able to ſmite and wound it, to infeſt and deſtroy the peace of it: but as farre as it is ſhadowed, or covered by the hand of God, it is devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; nor can any temptation, though never ſo fiery, kindle upon it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though the devil with his temptations may truly be look'd upon, as the efficient cauſes (in their kinde) of many the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſad diſturbances rais'd in the ſouls, and ſpirits of men; yet reaſon it ſelf teacheth, that God is the ſovereign and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream cauſe of them, at leaſt as they are penall, or afflictive to the creature, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Amos; ſhall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God doth, he doth not as a ſubordinate, but as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe. So that when the ſouls of men ſuffer in any kinde, Satan and his temptations are not ſo much the cauſe of them, as God, who doth not onely permit Satan to doe his doe, to act his part in them, but likewiſe withdraws his own preſence, and hides his face from the creature, which indeed is, as it were, the ſoul of the temptation, without which Satan, and all his <hi>militia</hi> can doe nothing conſiderable to afflict the ſoul. It no waies ſtands either with reaſon or Religion, to think, that the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:111412:84"/> creature ſhould ſuffer or be afflicted, eſpecially ſo deep and ſore, as many times it doth ſuffer, under ſome tentations, but by the ſpeciall order, providence and inſpection of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Indeed for whatſoever is ſinnefull in any temptation, we muſt finde out another father then God, who being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, cannot bring forth any impure, or unclean thing out of himſelf.</p>
            <p>But 5. (and laſtly) to anſwer home to the objection, or difficulty propounded; the queſtion is not concerning trouble of conſcience, or perplexity of ſoul in generall, or whither Satan with his temptations may not grievouſly infeſt and annoy the ſoul; but whether in thoſe great effects of this kinde, thoſe deep impreſſions of fear, dread, and aſtoniſhment, which are occaſioned or produced in men by the Scriptures faithfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, or effectually applied unto them, it be any waies reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to conceive, that Satan, and not God, hath principally to doe. What Satan may doe otherwiſe, or by temptations of another kinde, doth no waies encumber or concern the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in hand: Indeed if that efficacie and power which puts forth it ſelf in the Scriptures, truly and ſubſtantially preached, in ſmiting, wounding, and troubling the conſciences of men, can reaſonably be aſcribed unto him, this will (with more colour at leaſt) cut the ſtrength and ſinews of it, and render it infirm. But that this hath no degree of truth, or likelyhood of truth in it, may appear from hence: becauſe if Satan ſhould join with the Scriptures in affecting the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men with impreſſions of fear, and aſtoniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of thoſe things which are conteined in them, he ſhould join with them in aſſerting their authority, and truth in other things: which would be a pulling down of his own kingdome with both his hands: and Satan in ſuch a caſe ſhould <hi>be devided againſt</hi> Satan (as our Scripture ſpeaks) and then <hi>how could his kingdome ſtand?</hi> For he that atteſts the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for true, in any one vein of the matter or ſubject of them, though he doth not by this teſtimony, as fully atteſt or confirm the truth of all other things, in them, yet ſuch a teſtimony as this countenanceth the generality of them, and to a degree perſwades and opens a way likewiſe to a belief of the reſt.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:111412:85"/> Now Satan certainly is not in diſpoſition or will, a <hi>help</hi> of mens <hi>faith;</hi> nor yet in any ſuch act, which ſo plainly and directly tends hereunto, as that we ſpeak of. And beſides matter of faith or belief of the Scriptures, thoſe great effects we ſpeak of, the ſhaking of the conſciences, and overawing the ſpirits and hearts of men, being obſerved and known, are very proper to procure reverence and high eſteem unto them in the mindes and conſciences of men. Therefore whatſoever Satan may doe to diſturb the peace of the conſciences of men by his own weapons or fiery darts, which poſſibly he may ſometimes make of Scriptures, falſified, miſargued, or miſapplied; yet certainly he will not joyn or concurre with the Scriptures, in a direct way towards any ſuch effect, becauſe he knows that his loſſe will be farre greater, then his gain, thereby. Somewhat further relating to this objection, will be touched, in the anſwer to that which followeth.</p>
            <p>If it yet be further objected and ſaid; but may not ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as you ſpeak of, troubles, fears and conſternations of ſoul, be ingendred and caus'd in men, by ſome miſtake and miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures? either in the preacher or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of them, or in the hearers, or both? And can ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as theſe, thus occaſioned and rais'd, be any argument or proof, that the Scriptures, by which, though miſunderſtood, they are occaſioned, are from God?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that concerning trouble of conſcience, it may be occaſioned, either by the miſunderſtanding of ſome Scriptures, one or more, ſimply and alone, or in conjunction with the ignorance of ſome other Scriptures, with the true import and ſence of them. Now the truth is, that there can hardly any great trouble of conſcience be occaſioned in men or women, either by the miſunderſtanding, or right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all thoſe Scriptures, that are likely to occaſion trouble either in the one way, or in the other; but onely in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the ignorance or unbelief, of ſome others. For he that knows and beleeves that <hi>Jeſus Christ is the ſon of God; and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that whoſoever beleeves on him ſhall not periſh,</hi> but—and ſhall goe along in his reaſon and judgement with this truth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lightly be troubled (I mean with any trouble looking, or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:111412:85"/> tending towards deſpair) by occaſion of any other Scripture, or Scriptures, however underſtood, truly, or untruly. The truth of this aſſertion we have argued heretofore; and may again, upon occaſion. But for the preſent, to the objection propounded, we ſay this: that troubles of ſoul, agonies and perplexities of conſcience, being more generally occaſioned by the Scriptures, whether rightly, or not rightly underſtood, and ſeldome, if at all, otherwaies, or without them; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be conceiv'd or look'd upon, but as great inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, yea as ſtrong evidences, that the Scriptures are from God. For who is it that hath to doe with the conſciences of men, but God? or who doe men fear, in reference to eternity, but God alone? Are men afraid of being incountred by any created power, after they are paſs'd the line of mortality? or doe they ſee any creature beyond the grave, at whoſe ſight they have any cauſe to be troubled? So then it being God, and God onely, who makes the ſpirits and conſciences of men to quake and tremble, and it being the Scriptures and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely (upon the matter) by which the quaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of mens conſciences are from day to day produced: is not this a clear demonſtration that theſe two hold intelligence the one with the other, and that the one (God) puts forth that mighty power of his, in conſideration whereof the conſciences of men are ſo apt to tremble, in the other (the Scriptures.)</p>
            <p>That the conſciences of men are ſeldome much troubled or ſhaken, but by means of the Scriptures, appears from hence, that ſuch a thing as trouble of conſcience, is ſeldome or never heard of, from among pagans or infidells; no nor often out of ſuch places, where the Scriptures are not with ſome efficacy and power preached. And for thoſe other means, by which ſome ſuch effect as we ſpeak of, trouble of conſcience, may (happily) now and then be occaſioned, without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are generally ſuch, as the Scripture ſpeaks of, and gives teſtimony unto, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome great expreſſions, either of the juſtice and ſeverity, or of the glorious power of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that ſtill, that great effect we ſpeak of, the ſhaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is occaſioned, and produced either by the Scriptures themſelves, or by waies and means of a plain and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:111412:90"/> to be made ſober; from a reveller, to be changed into a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher; yet did he not by any change or alteration hereby wrought in him, attain the honour of a Saint, or ſon of God, or come to <hi>partake of the Divine nature.</hi> The incouragements, motives, <hi>promiſes,</hi> which Philoſophers were able to adminiſter and tender unto men; were not <hi>great and precious</hi> enough to work their hearts about unto holineſſe, or to tranſport and carry them out of themſelves unto God. Indeed the <hi>promiſes</hi> and incouragements by which ſome of them attempted the hearts and ſpirits of their diſciples, to make them more then ordinary men, were <hi>great</hi> enough to have effected this; yea and more then they projected or intended: for they alſo ſpake of <hi>life and immortality,</hi> and avouched the abiding of many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things after death, for thoſe who ſhould hearken to the voice of their precepts and inſtructions. But though their <hi>promiſes</hi> in this kinde were <hi>great</hi> enough for their purpoſe, yet were they not <hi>precious</hi> enough: they wanted a Jeſus Chriſt at the bottome of them, to give credit and authority, to give life and power, and fulneſſe of intereſt in the ſouls and conſciences of men, unto them: thorough a deficiencie whereof they were able onely to beget a dead faith, and a dead hope in men, of the things promiſed: now it muſt be, not a dead, but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>faith that worketh by love:</hi> and ſo it muſt be, not a dead, but <hi>a lively hope,</hi> which muſt ſet men on work to <hi>purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even as he (i.</hi> God himſelf) <hi>is pure.</hi> Philoſophicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were ſufficient to prevail with men to deny themſelves in luſts and practiſes, which were more ignoble, ſenſuall, and vile, but left them to ſeek themſelves in others of a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, though no leſſe ſinfull, nature and import, as vain-glory, ſelf-admiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas the <hi>promiſes</hi> advanced by the Scriptures, are of that ſtrength and intereſt in the ſouls and conſciences of men, that they ſuffer them not to ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any thing that is terrene, much leſſe in any thing that is ſinfull; but carrying them over, and beyond all theſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to ſeek themſelves in God onely, and his ſervice. Thus then we ſee difference in abundance, between thoſe changes which are ſometimes wrought by Philoſophicall receipts in men, and thoſe which are frequently ſeen and

            <p>If you ask me, but by what rule ſhall we be able to judge of excellencie of wiſedome, and choiceneſſe of underſtanding? what is that which you call excellencie of wiſedome that when we ſee or apprehend it, we may be able to acknowledge it, and do reverence unto it. To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all men are not alike capable of the knowledge of wiſedome; nor alike apprehenſive of the excellencie and choiceneſſe of underſtanding. Some men are by nature of low, dull and depreſſed underſtandings, who cannot riſe, no not to an ordinary pitch to conceive and reach things of a middle nature, or of any whit more then of a common purport. Others have their lot of reaſon, apprehenſion, and capacity aſſign'd unto them by God, in a better ground: I mean, they are naturally more ready and quick of apprehenſion, can reliſh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſte wiſedome when they meet with it, ſooner, and with leſſe conſideration and fewer debates upon things, then others. Now for the former of theſe perſons that are ſlow of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:111412:91"/> it is very hard to preſcribe them a rule, whereby to judge of excellencie of wiſedom, that they are capable of; but onely the rule of much labour and diligence to conſider the nature, and tendencie of things propoſed to them. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, If the <hi>iron be blunt,</hi> and a man hath not whet it to an edge, <hi>he muſt put the moe ſtrength to it:</hi> So where nature <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 10.</note> hath not confer'd an eſtate of reaſon and underſtanding, they muſt be content to betake themſelves to the hand of diligence and induſtry, if they mean to live and act at the ſame rate of wiſedome with other men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some by <hi>reaſon of uſe,</hi> habit, or cuſtome (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>have their wits,</hi> or <hi>ſences exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil;</hi> he ſpeaks of the diſcerning of things ſpiritually good, and ſpiritually evil; and conſequently of diſcerning things, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14.</note> truly good, and truly evil. Theſe differences of things, <hi>good and evil,</hi> are moſt conſiderable in ſpirituall things; and of light conſequence in all others. Now as ſome have their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their <hi>ſences</hi> (he means their intellectuall <hi>ſences) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in diſcerning good and evill, i.</hi> that are ever and anon, weighing, and ſtudying and conſidering matters of a ſpirituall nature, to finde out truth from errour, and that which is <hi>good,</hi> from that which is <hi>evil;</hi> ſo there are others, whoſe <hi>ſences,</hi> in this kinde, through diſuſe, grow ruſty, and unfit for thoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and functions, which are moſt naturall and proper to them. Now for thoſe that have their <hi>ſences</hi> ſo <hi>exerciſed,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, they need no rule to be given them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcern or judge of excellencie of wiſedome; the very conſtitution, frame and temper of their ſences, or diſcerning faculty, is a ſufficient rule unto them in this kinde: as the very palate or taſte of ſome men, qualifies them to an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, without any other rule, to apprehend with all exactneſſe the different taſts both of meats and drinks. The excellent ſtrains, the ſavour and taſte of the wiſedom of God in the Goſpel, is (doubtleſſe) ſtrongly and with much ſatisfaction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by ſuch men. Yet</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, to fix a generall rule, whereby to judge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of wiſedome and underſtanding (at leaſt in one of the moſt conſiderable ſubjects or objects of it) and herein alſo
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:111412:91"/> to ſhew them wherein this excellency conſiſts; excellency of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (in the generall) conſiſts as in other things, ſo chiefly in this: <hi>viz.</hi> in the contrivement of ſuch means, for the bringing of any great and much deſirable end to paſſe, ſuch an end which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and according to all rule of common apprehenſion, is very difficult, and ſcarce poſſible to be brought to paſſe; wiſedom (I ſay) chiefly ſtands in the contrivement of ſuch means for the bringing ſuch an end as this to paſſe, which have theſe four properties in them. 1. A ſtrong, and indiſſolvable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the end, <hi>i.</hi> when they are ſuch, which can hardly, if at all, be defeated or miſcarry. 2. An equitableneſſe or righteouſneſſe thorowout; when there is nothing ſinfull, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unjuſt or unworthy in them. 3. A ſweetneſſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of proportion to the end; <hi>i.</hi> when the ſtrength of that connexion, which they have with the end, lies more in the ſtratagem, I mean in the manner of the contrivance, hath moſt of the head in it, and as little of the arme, or right-down force, as may be. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and laſt propertie, Is a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſſe of the whole, or main of the projection or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, from the common thoughts or apprehenſions of men: this is, when the means we ſpeak of is of ſuch a nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as it were, of ſuch ingredients, and made up into ſuch a deviſe, which was no waies likely to have entred into the heart or thoughts of any other, but onely his, who is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of it. I ſhall not ſtand to argue any of theſe particulars; nor yet to prove, that excellencie of wiſedome conſiſts in them; the reaſon why I place wiſedome, and that in the excellencie and glory of it, in theſe jointly taken, is evident enough by a diligent conſideration of them reſpectively and together. I ſhall (for the preſent) onely ſhew you how you may by the rule now delivered unto you, be able to diſcern and judge ſomewhat, of that excellent and choice wiſedome, which rules and reigns, yea triumphs in the frame and compoſure of the Goſpel; this onely premis'd by way of caution, that we doe not limit or confine wiſedom in the excellencie of it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the contrivement of means of what nature or property ſoever, or for the compaſſing or obtaining of what end ſoever. There may be an excellencie of wiſedom, 1. In the election of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:111412:92"/> mens ends (at leaſt their particular and ſubordinate ends) as <hi>viz.</hi> in ſetting up godlineſſe, or excelling in grace, for a mans end, before riches, or greatneſſe in the world; and ſo, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the good, or comfort of others, a mans end, rather then himſelf, or his own advancement in outward things; though the truth is, that in propriety of ſpeech, the chuſing of ſuch ends as theſe, is rather a chuſing of means, then of ends. Indeed if we ſpeak of the great and ultimate end of <hi>men,</hi> their <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> their ſoveraign good, wiſedom hath no place in the chuſing of this, but nature onely. All men naturally, without any deliberation or conſultation upon the matter, deſire happineſſe; this is every mans end without exception: though there be a vaſt difference among men in traverſing, or proſecuting this end, anſwerable to their different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning the nature and ſubſtance of the end it ſelf. Again</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is choiceneſſe of wiſedom too in a due and diligent proſecution of means, as well as in a choice contrivance of means. <hi>The ſluggard</hi> or the ſlothfull man, and the fool, or <hi>man deſtitute of underſtanding,</hi> are one and the ſame with <hi>Solomon;</hi> and otherwhile, the wiſe man and the diligent, or induſtrious, the ſame. And this wiſedom I would gladly recommend unto you (my brethren of this Church and fellowſhip.) I wiſh your wiſedom in proſecuting the means of your ſpirituall wellfare, were like unto the faith of the Romanes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. which was <hi>famous throughout the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Wiſedom likewiſe is ſeen, and may be ſeen in much of his excellencie and ſtrength, in judging of connexions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions between cauſes and effects, whether naturall or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: as in being able to diſcern and foreſee, what men of ſuch and ſuch principles, of ſuch and ſuch practiſes, are like to doe in ſuch and ſuch caſes, under ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as God by means of the infiniteneſſe of his wiſedom was able certainly to foreſee, how the men of <hi>Keilab</hi> would have dealt <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 15, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But however wiſedome may have place to ſhew her ſelf, and that with much excellencie, in theſe and haply in ſome other particulars beſides theſe, as well as in the contrivement of means for the bringing any end whatſoever to paſſe; yet I have made choice of this head rather then any of the reſt, as more commodious and proper to work upon, and proſecute, for that end and purpoſe which we have in hand; <hi>viz.</hi> to make you capable (in ſome meaſure) of diſcerning that tranſcendent excellencie of wiſedome, which ſhines in the face of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (and of the Goſpel more particularly) and makes it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, even like unto the appearance of that <hi>inviſible</hi> one, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, though inviſible.</p>
            <p>Firſt then you muſt underſtand and conſider diſtinctly, what that end, or endes are (be they one, or more, at leaſt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and moſt conſiderable of them) which God propounds to himſelf in the Goſpel, I mean which he diſcovers in the Goſpel that he doth, or hath propounded to himſelf; and which he purſues and proſecutes by thoſe means which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed therein: Becauſe without a diſtinct knowledge of theſe ends, you can never apprehend nor judge to any purpoſe, the excellencie of the wiſedome in thoſe means, by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends (and is every day at work accordingly) to bring thoſe ends to paſſe. His great and ſupream end, is the glorifying of himſelf, yet not ſimply this neither; but the glorifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch or ſuch a way, or, by ſuch and ſuch means, as <hi>viz.</hi> the ſalvation of <hi>ſome,</hi> and the condemnation of others, of that kinde of creature of his, which is called, man, and him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſinfull or fallen. And not ſimply this neither, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of himſelf in the ſalvation of ſome, and condemnation of others: but the glorifying of himſelf like unto himſelf, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> upon terms of the higheſt and richeſt advantage for his glory. He might poſſibly have glorifyed himſelf at an under rate, both in the one and in the other, without going that way to work, which now he hath done, for the glorifying himſelf in them. So that the ſalvation and condemnation of men, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the glory of God, procured and rais'd by them, have the nature and conſideration of means; though otherwiſe, in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:111412:93"/> reſpect of the means by which themſelves are accompliſhed and brought to paſſe, they have the nature of ends. Now when I ſay and affirm, that Gods great end which he diſcovers in the Goſpel as intended to be brought about by him by the means there ſpecified, is the glorifying of himſelf, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men; I doe not intend to deny, but that God hath many other means and deſignes on foot in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for the glorifying of himſelf, beſides theſe (I mean the ſalvation and condemnation of men) but this is that I would ſay; that by what means ſoever beſides theſe, ſpoken of in the Goſpel, God intends to glorifie himſelf, they all relate unto theſe, and are ſubordinate unto and reſolve themſelves into theſe. So that this ſtill remains an unqueſtionable truth, that Gods great end held forth in the Goſpel, is the glorifying of himſelf like himſelf, partly in the ſalvation, partly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place to give you yet ſome further light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſee and judge the excellencie of wiſedome in the Goſpel, you muſt conſider, that the glorifying of God by the ſalvation and condemnation of men (at leaſt as now they are devis'd and intended by him to be effected) is an end of very high and glorious conſequence, not onely in reſpect of God himſelf, but of the creature alſo, both men and Angels (I mean thoſe of either kinde, whom God hath, or ſhall think worthy to take into part and fellowſhip with himſelf in his own bleſſedneſſe and glory.) We ſhall not now ſtand to argue or prove this; but take it for granted, as being a thing cleer, and eaſie to be aſſented unto. Onely it is to be taken into conſideration, for our preſent purpoſe; becauſe, if that which is the chief and ſupream end of the Goſpel, were but ſome light, ordinary, or inconſiderable thing, there were no place for that excellencie of wiſedom we ſpeak of, to be found in any means whatſoever for the effecting of it. Yea it argues rather weakneſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any thing elſe, to be curious and profound in contriving means for bringing that to paſſe, which being effected is of little or no conſequence unto any.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) it is yet further to be conſidered, concerning this end we ſpeake of (the glorifying of God,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:111412:93"/> in the ſalvation and condemnation of men) that it is an end of ſuch a nature and conſideration, that being ſeriouſly thought of, and narrowly inquired into, it will be found to be ſuch a thing, ſuch an end, as was not compaſſable, was not to be attained or brought to paſſe by any other perſon, one or more, nor in any other way, or by any other means, then by him who hath now taken it in hand, and is in the purſuite of it (I mean, God himſelf) and that in that way and method of means, wherein he purſues it. Neither ſhall we ſpend time (for the preſent) in the demonſtration of this; it being a point which frequently comes to hand; and beſides hath no great difficulty in it to be apprehended and beleeved. Onely the remembrance of it, is neceſſary for our preſent occaſion: becauſe, if the glorifying of God upon the terms we ſpeak of <hi>(viz.</hi> in or by the ſalvation and condemnation of men fallen) were an end, either in it ſelf, or in reſpect of any wiſedom, ſtrength, or power of any creature, or creatures whatſoever, of an eaſie aſſecution, obvious to be attain'd, the wiſedom of God which hath contrived the way and means for the obtaining of it, would be leſſe conſiderable, and the excellencie of it not ſo like to affect, or take the hearts and ſouls of men. For that which every man, or men of ordinary abilities, can doe, no man will much value the doing of it, by whomſoever it be done; no not though there be more then ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, skill, or wiſdom ſhewed in the effecting of it. But now the glorifying of God in the ſalvation and condemnation of ſinfull men, being not only a thing of a moſt tranſcendent conſequence and import, but of a very difficult, and next to an impoſſible performance, it yields the fulleſt and largeſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that can be imagined, for the greateſt excellencie of wiſedom that can be conceived, to ſhew it ſelf in contriving a way or means how to accompliſh it. Thus farre then we have prepared your judgements and underſtandings, to conceive of the excellencie of wiſedom in the Goſpel: We have ſhewed you, that the great end there preſented and driven at, will not onely bear or admit an excellencie of wiſedom, but neceſſarily requires, calls aloud for an excellencie of wiſedom, yea the greateſt excellencie in this kinde that can be imagined, for the effecting of it.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:111412:94"/>
            <p>In the next place then, let us conſider, whether the means, which the Goſpel tenders unto us, as contrived and diſpoſed by God, for the effecting of the great end mentioned, hath not all thoſe four characters or properties in it of an excellencie of wiſedom, formerly expreſſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt was this; <hi>a ſtrong and indiſſolvable connexion with the end;</hi> when a means is ſuch, or ſo laid, that it cannot lightly prove abortive, or miſcarry. And is not the courſe, and means which God (according to the report of the Goſpel) hath taken for the glorifying of himſelf in the ſalvation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men, a means of this property and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Firſt, can the ſalvation of men miſcarry in the hand of ſuch a Mediatour and Redeemer, ſo great and glorious, every waies ſo accompliſhed for his undertaking in this kinde, as with grace, goodneſſe, love, wiſedom, power, intereſt with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Goſpel exhibits him to the world, on whoſe ſhoulder the weight of this great buſineſſe is here laid? Is not ſuch a Saviour <hi>every</hi> waies <hi>able,</hi> yea and willing, to ſave thoſe, and that perfectly, that ſhall <hi>come unto him?</hi> And ſhall not thoſe moſt certainly <hi>come unto him</hi> (and ſo partake of ſalvation by him) whom God the <hi>Father ſhall draw,</hi> and perſwade effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to come? Therefore certainly that means which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-holds forth, for the ſaving of men, is a means of efficacie and power, a means that will reach the end with an high hand, and againſt, and above, all contradiction. And the ſalvation of men, upon the Goſpel terms, in that way, and by the means we ſpeak of, is every whit as effectuall for the glorifying of God. The glorifying of God, is but the naturall, or eſſentiall reſult of the ſalvation of men in the Goſpel way, as will further appear in opening the other properties.</p>
            <p>Again for the condemnation of men, we need not queſtion but that there is place and room enough left in the Goſpel, for many to periſh, and to be condemned, and that moſt certainly, <hi>viz.</hi> all ſuch as ſhall not beleeve, and continue unbeleeving unto the end. But that which is mainly conſiderable in this point, is: not, that many ſhall certainly periſh, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel; but that ſuch proviſion is partly made in the Goſpel, partly here declar'd to be made otherwiſe, that every
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:111412:94"/> perſon without exception, man or woman, that ſhall periſh notwithſtanding the Goſpel, ſhall yet ſo periſh, and upon ſuch terms, that God ſhall be highly glorifyed in their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in their periſhing. His perfect hatred of ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt touch or tincture or mixture of any unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea or any hardneſſe or rigorouſneſſe of proceedings, ſhall only appear in their condemnation: they ſhall periſh with their blood upon their own heads; as we ſhall ſee further in the next particular.</p>
            <p>The ſecond property of a means, wherein (in conjunction with the former, and the other two remaining) the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of wiſedom doth appear, is, an equitableneſſe, or cleerneſſe of righteouſneſſe thoroughout; when there is nothing injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or oppreſſive unto any, nothing that bears hard upon any principle or rule of juſtice or equity, within the whole courſe or compaſſe of the means projected. It is cleerly repugnant to the principles of wiſedom, much more of the excellencie of wiſedom, to put any polluted or diſhonourable ingredient into any means whatſoever, whatſoever the end be which we deſire to accompliſh by it. But when a means is ſtrong and greater then reſiſtance, and yet hath nothing hard, nor unequall in it, the end being excellent and of high concernment, thus farre an excellencie of wiſedom diſcovers it ſelf, in the election and contrivement of it. Now moſt certain and evident it is, that the means contriv'd in the Goſpel, for the glorifying of God, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, hath this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon it in the faireſt and moſt viſible manner that can be. For 1. Whom did God injure or deal hardly by in the leaſt, in any thing which relates either to the ſalvation, or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men according to the Goſpel? The greateſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hard meaſure offered to any in this kinde, is in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement and ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But 1. the common ſaying is, <hi>volenti non fit injurin;</hi> nothing is an injury which is done to a man with his will, and free conſent. Now <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was moſt willing to take up, and bear that great burthen of the world, that lay upon his ſhoulder in ſhame and ſufferings. <hi>Therefore doth my father love me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe I lay down my life, that I may</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>take it again: no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:111412:95"/>
            <p>If it be here ſaid; But what though <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> was never ſo willing to ſuffer what he did; yet might there not be ſome hard meaſure (at leaſt) offered unto him, in putting him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? Good diſpoſitions may be wrong'd, not onely when they are forc'd upon the doing thoſe things, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, and which they are unwilling to doe; but when they are wrought upon by perſwaſion, and drawn into a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to doe that, which is inconvenient or prejudiciall to them. To this I anſwer (in a word) goodneſſe of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it is attended and guarded with excellencie of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence, ſo that it knows how to repair any breach, that it ſhall be willing to make upon it ſelf, for the good of others, is not at all obnoxious to any ſuch danger or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, as to be drawn to any thing prejudiciall to it. Now this was the bleſſed frame and temper of the heart of Jeſus Chriſt; as he had goodneſſe in abundance, even to act him to a willing <hi>laying down his life</hi> for men: ſo had he wiſedom in abundance, even to teach him how, and upon what terms to <hi>lay it down,</hi> ſo that he might receive, or <hi>take it again</hi> [and that indeed upon terms of advantage] and his father (it ſeems) loved him as well, if not as much, for this wiſedom, as for that goodneſſe. This I conceive to be cleerly aſſerted by himſelf, in the Scripture lately cited; <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, becauſe I lay down my life</hi> [ſo, or upon ſuch terms, of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, righteouſneſſe, and will] <hi>that I may [viz</hi> in a way of juſtice and equity, and without the leaſt diſhonour unto him] <hi>take</hi> [or rather, receive] <hi>it again</hi> from him.</p>
            <p>Again, goodneſſe of diſpoſition is not in danger neither to be wrought upon to inconvenience, by thoſe, who are tender and jealous over it, and withall prudent and wiſe, to know what things are hurtfull and prejudiciall to it. Now the Goſpel informs us, that it was God the Father, who put his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon thoſe ſufferings, which he ſuffered for the ſalvation of the world: and he (we know) was farre from working in any unworthy or unkinde manner, upon the ſweet diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sonne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nor (doubtleſſe) would he ever have drawn this ſonne of his into ſuch an ingagement, of ſo much ſhame and ſorrow, and ſuffering, no not for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:111412:95"/> of the world, if he had not known how to have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed him to the full for all the labour, and travail of his ſoul therein.</p>
            <p>Again; true it is, in the courſe of means, which the Goſpel holds forth as projected and laid by God for the ſalvation of men, the troubles and ſufferings of other men alſo, are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially of the Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpel. Men cannot be ſaved without beleeving, they cannot beleeve without hearing: they cannot hear without Preaching: nor can the Miniſters of the Goſpel preach unto them, without expoſing themſelves to many troubles and perſecutions from the world for their work ſake. I have ſometimes opened that paſſage of the Apoſtle unto you, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. from whence we took notice of two things as neceſſary for the ſalvation of <note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> men. The firſt, is the making of a Goſpel: the ſecond, the making known, or preaching of this Goſpel: and both theſe (as we ſhewed at large, when time was) require ſufferings: the former, the <hi>ſufferings of Chriſt;</hi> the latter, the ſufferings of thoſe, who ſhall Preach and publiſh this Goſpel in the world. In which reſpect, the Apoſtle here calls his <hi>afflictions</hi> in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, <hi>the filling up of that which is behind of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Chriſt, for his body ſake, which is the Church; i.</hi> for the actuall effecting of their ſalvation. But the caſe is every whit as cleer here (if not much cleerer) I mean in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no wrong done unto them by God, whatſoever they ſuffer in this kinde from men, as it was in the ſufferings of Chriſt himſelfe. We ſhall not need ſtand to argue this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there is no injurie or wrong unto any perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever included in the means, which God hath projected for the ſalvation of men, and the glorifying of himſelf herein; ſo neither is there any thing that entrencheth upon any rule of juſtice or equity, ſimply conſidered, and without relation unto perſons. God might (I mean in regard of his executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not his will, for this is doubtfull in the caſe;) he might by a ſtrong hand have ſav'd men, without any injury done either to man, or Angell; and yet have ſeem'd (at leaſt) to have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:111412:96"/> diſpenſed with ſome main principles or rules of equity or juſtice, in ſaving them; as <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe he had ſav'd them, without any atonement at all made for them; or without an atonement of full conſideration and value; or if he had ſay'd them, whilſt they were yet impenitent, and altogether ſinfull, before their mindes were changed. To take a murtherer, or malefactour in any kinde, immediately upon the murther, or other act of vileneſſe committed, and without any account given, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhewen for the ſinne, to make him a King, and ſet him up upon a throne; carries a ſtrong appearance (at leaſt) of injuſtice, or of ſomewhat that is as bad, in it. But ſuppoſe there were any perfect atonement, that it were poſſible for a murtherer to make for the murther he hath committed, and this atonement ſhould be made by him; and further, he ſhould give full ſatisfaction, that he was now become a new man, and abhor'd any inclination unto blood; in this caſe, and upon theſe terms, if he ſhould be countenanced, or prefer'd to any place of dignity or honour, whereof he was otherwiſe capable, there were no colour of injuſtice in it, or unworthineſſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. This is the caſe of the ſalvation of men, according to the tenour of that way and means, which God, according to Scripture information, hath deviſed to effect it. He ſaves, he exempts, no ſinner from deſerved puniſhment (much leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth any unto glory) but onely ſuch, for whoſe ſin, or ſins, 1. a plenary atonement hath been made already: 2. who have unfeignedly repented of their ſinners, and are become new creatures, and perfect haters of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) as to the condemnation of men, every whit as evident it is, that there is not the leaſt touch of injuſtice, nor of any thing that is unequall or hard, in all that method or courſe of means, by which it is effected, or taketh place. Indeed if God ſhould deprive men of all ability and power to repent and to beleeve, and then ſhould be ſtill moving and perſwading, ſtill intreating and beſeeching, urging and preſſing them to beleeve with that patheticalneſſe of affection, wherein he expreſſeth himſelf in the Scriptures, even to thoſe that periſh, as well as to thoſe that are ſaved; this would ſeem very hard, yea ſomewhat harder then injuſtice it ſelf; but this is not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:111412:96"/> ſo. As if a King having caus'd a mans leggs to be cut of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he hath done it in a way of juſtice, and according to the law, <hi>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,</hi> this man having cut off the leggs of another; yet if he ſhould urge, preſſe and perſwade ſuch a man as this, whoſe leggs he hath cut off, to runne a race with thoſe that have their limbs, and are ſwift of foot, and ſhould promiſe him, with many expreſſions of love, exceeding great rewards, if he would quit himſelf in the race like a man, and come as ſoon to the goal, as they that runne with him; this would be a carriage ſavouring more of a bloudy and unmanlike inſolencie over this poor wretch in his miſery, then of any reall affection, grace, or reſpect towards him, or of any deſire of his good: in like manner to conceive that God applieth himſelf with ſuch moving and melting expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mercy, tenderneſſe of bowels, love, grace, bounty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> towards his creature, man, as the Scripture from place to place emphatically aſſerts that he doth, yea towards very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unworthy men, promiſing unto them life, and glory, and the great things of the world to come, if they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, repent, and turn unto him; and yet to ſuppoſe withall, that theſe men, to whom he maketh theſe rich and ſweet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of himſelf, are wholly deſtitute of all power to doe what he requires of them in this caſe, to ſave them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to conferre the great things promiſed upon them, as <hi>viz.</hi> to beleeve and repent, is to repreſent the glorious God in his greateſt expreſſions of mercy and grace, and love unto the world, rather as laughing the world to ſcorn in that great miſery wherein it is plunged, then as a God any waies truly deſirous, or intending to relieve it, his glorious overtures and profeſſions of love, grace, and favour towards it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. Some indeed imagine that they ſee ſuch a face of God as this, preſenting it ſelf in the glaſſe of the Goſpel. But, God giving life and opportunity, we ſhall demonſtrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew and prove in due time, that all ſuch conceptions are moſt unworthy of God, and wholly inconſiſtent with thoſe things, which the Scriptures hold forth and teach, as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, as thoſe gracious abilities which he hath indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently confer'd upon men, in and through the <hi>ſecond,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:111412:97"/> their fall in the <hi>firſt, Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third property mentioned of an excellencie of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, diſcovering it ſelf in the contrivement of a means for the compaſſing ſuch an end as we ſpake of, was, when the means have a ſweetneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of proportion to the end, <hi>i.</hi> (as we further explain'd it) when the ſtrength of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion (formerly ſpoken of) which they have with the end, lies more in the ſtratagem, <hi>i.</hi> in the manner of contrivance, and hath moſt of the head in it, requiring as little of the arme, or rightdown force for the execution of any thing, as may be. Now that the means, which the Goſpel holds forth, for the bringing about that great end, the glorifying of God in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, hath this character alſo, or property in them, is evident upon theſe two grounds or conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is nothing within the whole compaſſe of this means, which is to be effected by the power of God (I mean by his executive power) but what in a way of reaſon, wiſedom, and equity, may, yea and ought to be effected, yea and is morally, or in the juſtly-moving-cauſes effected, before God puts forth his out-ſtretched arme, for the literall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall execution of it; nothing is belayed, or ſpoken of, as to be effected or done by the power of God, but what natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as it were, and with a rationall voice, calls for this power of his to effect it, even as grapes when they are fully ripe, call for the hand of the gatherer, and corn when that is ripe, for the hand of the reaper. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe all other parts or ingredients in the means we ſpeak of, which doe not ſtand in any executive force or power, but rather in a ſimple contrivement, doe in the eye of reaſon, and of a conſiderate underſtanding, look with a very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleaſant aſpect, upon that great end. And becauſe the Goſpel conſiſts of ſuch a means for the glorifying of God, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, as hath been ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> which is effectuall and potent as to the obtaining of the end, and yet the potencie of it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the wiſe contrivement of things in reference to the end, and not in force; hence (I conceive) it may well be that the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:111412:97"/> Apoſtle calls the Goſpel, both the <hi>wiſdom of God, and the power of God. But unto them that are called, both of the Jews and Grecians, we preach Chriſt, the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1 24. By, Chriſt, he means the Doctrine of Chriſt, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel; which he calls <hi>the power of God;</hi> becauſe it is ſo effectually potent for the end; and withall, <hi>the wiſdom of God;</hi> becauſe this potencie chiefly conſiſts in the wiſdom of it.</p>
            <p>Let us begin with the former conſideration. There are but four great turnings, or tranſactions of things (in the generall) within the compaſſe of that means, which the Goſpel holds forth, for the glorifying of God in the ſalvation and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of men, that are to be effected by the unbaring of the mighty arme of God. The firſt, is the raiſing of Chriſt from the dead, with the appurtenances and conſequences thereof. The ſecond the deſtroying of the devil (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>i.</hi> the cutting him off from the exerciſe of that power, which he was intereſſed in, and poſſeſſed of, over all fleſh, firſt, to make men and women doe his work, whilſt they live: ſecondly, after death, to torment them night and day for ever. Now the devil is by a ſtrong hand, reſtrained from the exerciſe of this power, eſpecially in reference to the Saints: and if it be not to all men, it is through their own negligence and default. The third, is the caſting of wicked and impenitent perſons into hell, with the things appertaining thereunto; The fourth and the laſt is, the advancement of the Saints unto their eſtate of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with what is requiſite hereunto. I doe not (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) remember any thing beſides theſe four (with their members and appurtenances) within the compaſſe of the means, we ſpeak of, that is to be tranſacted, by the immediate force and power of the omnipotent arme of God. It is true, the power of God is ſometimes put forth in drawing men unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> when they beleeve; ſo the Saints are ſaid to be kept <hi>by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> but the power of God we ſpeak of, works in theſe, and ſuch like effects as <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> theſe, by means proportionable to them; as when he makes grapes to grow upon the vine, and <hi>graſſe to grow upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> he works both one and the other with his omnipotent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:111412:98"/> power (for he hath no other power, but this) but he works by means proportionable unto the things produced by him. But when he rais'd the Lord Chriſt from the dead, he did not put on any covering of fleſh on his arme, but wrought with it bare: and ſo when he ſhall compell the wicked to goe into hell fire, having rais'd them from the dead (by way of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative thereunto) ſo again when he ſhall put the righteous into a condition of perfect bleſſedneſſe and of glory, having rais'd them alſo from the dead, by way of preparation to it; he will, and muſt interpoſe with his almighty power upon the ſame terms, <hi>viz.</hi> without the concurrence or cooperation of any ſecond cauſe, or cauſes, apt or likely to produce theſe great effects. Now then this is that which we ſay, that for all the four particulars mentioned, though they are to be effected, and brought to paſſe, by ſtrength of arme, yet there is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and contrivance of things precedaneous to every of them, yea, ſo pleaſantly introductive to them, that they will ſeem to be as much (if not more) acts of wiſdom, reaſon and equity, as acts of power; and conſequently there will no more of this executive power of God be ſeen in bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that great end of glorifying himſelf in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, then needs muſt. To run through the particulars, with as much brevity as may be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the raiſing of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead (which is a maſter vein in the body of the means, which the Goſpel preſents unto us for the end ſo often ſpecified, and carries a great breadth in them) 1. Was there not all the reaſon in the world, why God ſhould raiſe him again from the dead? was there, or is there any thing, to diſparage that act of God, either in point of wiſdom, righteouſneſſe, or equity, by which he rais'd him from the dead? Did he not live holily, and blameleſly in this preſent world, whilſt his naturall life ſtood by him? Did he not challenge all his enemies to <hi>rebuke him of ſin;</hi> and none of them accept the challenge? yea and were not his inward parts as <hi>full of grace and truth</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh) as his life was of the fruits and expreſſions of them? There was no ſpot or blemiſh of ſinne to be found in him, body, or foul. So that there was not the leaſt cauſe, nor colour of a cauſe, why God ſhould leave him
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:111412:98"/> in the hand of death in reſpect of any thing relating to himſelf, or why he ſhould not raiſe him up again: yea the truth is, that thus farre there was no cauſe why he ſhould ſo much as <hi>taſt of death:</hi> much leſſe why he ſhould be left in the hand of death. Again, as touching his undertaking for others (I mean of expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and making atonement for the ſinnes of the world) it is true, there was reaſon, why in reſpect of this, he ſhould die, or taſt of death; becauſe otherwiſe he could not have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his undertaking. But there was no reaſon, why having perform'd this, and that with a ſurpluſſage of performance, not only dying, but remaining in the bands of death for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time then was ſimply neceſſary for that expiation, there was no reaſon (I ſay) in reſpect of this neither, why God ſhould not raiſe him from the dead. Nay what in reſpect of his innocencie, and of his willingneſſe to lay down his life for others, and of his full accompliſhment of what he intended and undertook to doe, yea or was neceſſary for him to doe, for others; it was no way conſiſting with the wiſdom or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, not to have made out that outſtretched arme of his power which he did, to raiſe him from the dead. And in this reſpect it was, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, as he did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>whom God hath raiſed up and looſed the ſorrows of death, becauſe it was unpoſſible that he ſhould be holden of it, i.</hi> of death. How, or in what reſpect, was it <hi>unpoſſible</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>held by death?</hi> It was not <hi>unpoſſible</hi> in reſpect of that nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap>mply in reſpect of the Divine nature, wherein he had communion, even whilſt he ſuffered death, as well as in that nature, wherein he ſuffered death; nor was it unpoſſible ſimply in reſpect of that abſolute holineſſe and freedom from ſinne, which was in him; but this <hi>impoſſibility</hi> (I conceive) ſprang chiefly from an utter inconſiſtencie with the righteouſneſſe and goodneſſe of God, to ſuffer a perſon ſo innocent and holy as Chriſt was, and withall, having fully accompliſhed what he undertook by dying, to remain any longer in the bands and priſon of death. So that this act of God in <hi>raiſing up Chriſt from the dead</hi> is (as was ſaid) to be look'd upon every whit as much (if not more) as an act of righteouſneſſe, and of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:111412:99"/> equity, as of power; yea the righteouſneſſe and wiſdom which together ſhine forth in it, give, as it were, a gracious luſtre, and ſet off, to the power that appear'd in it. <hi>The Kings ſtrength</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) loveth judgement,</hi> [or righteouſneſſe.] <note place="margin">Pſal. 99 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As there was a neceſſity that God ſhould raiſe Chriſt from the dead, in reſpect of the righteouſneſſe of his will, which could not ſuffer ſo righteous a perſon, as he was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the power of death, without cauſe; ſo was there a neceſſity alſo of the ſame act on Gods part, by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or wiſdom, <hi>viz.</hi> to accommodate that great end we ſo oft ſpeak of, the glorifying of himſelf in the ſalvation and condemnation of men. Neither could, either the one, or the other (I mean, either the ſalvation, or condemnation of men) have taken place, or been brought to paſſe upon the like terms of advantage for his glory, had not the raiſing of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, been one ingredient in the means of either. Firſt, they that are ſaved, could not be ſaved (at leaſt upon any ſuch terms) without being juſtified; juſtified they could not be, without beleeving; beleeve they could not, but by and through, and by means of the riſing again of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the dead. <hi>Who by his means</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note>

For were not <hi>Chriſt</hi> preſented and preach'd unto wicked men, as being in ſuch a condition, wherein he is every waies meet and worthy to be beleeved on, their unbelief, with all the ſinne that accompanies it, would not be ſo heavy upon them; nor could God make any ſuch earnings of glory, as now he doth, of their condemnation (as might be ſhewed more at large,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:111412:99"/> but for brevities ſake, <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15.</note> The preaching of Chriſt, as he is deſcribed and held forth in the Goſpel, in regard of the many mighty motives, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, advantages, for beleeving, which of neceſſity muſt be tendered unto men in ſuch a preaching of him, muſt needs render thoſe altogether inexcuſable, who beleeve not. So that though there be ſomewhat of the arme, and executive power, in the means which the Goſpel holds forth for the glorifying of God in the ſalvation and condemnation of men; yet there is no more (at leaſt as to that particular we laſt ſpake of; and we ſhall ſhew the like in others) then needs muſt, and what the excellencie of wiſedome in the contrivement, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>A ſecond particular in the means we ſpeak of, wherein the power of the arme of God is engaged and put forth, is the <hi>deſtruction of the devil i.</hi> (as we interpreted it) the forcible reſtraining of him, from tempting men in this life eſpecially above, or beyond, what they are able; and the abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining him from tormenting them afterwards. Now the arme of God in this act alſo, is cloathed with ſo much righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe on the one hand, and wiſdom on the other, that the power that is put forth in it, is hereby made every waies beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and lovely. Firſt the righteouſneſſe of God, in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devil, with the double deſtruction we ſpeak of, appears as to both the degrees or parts of it, thus. It is righteous for God to reſtrain any creature whatſoever from any act, which it hath no right or intereſt to doe, or perform: but the devil hath no right or intereſt to tempt men (leſt of all the Saints, and thoſe that beleeve) above what they are able to bear, or overcome, nor yet to torment them afterwards. Therefore it is every waies juſt and righteous for God to reſtrain him in this kinde: nor is there any thing of any hard reflexion upon God in it.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, but why hath the devil no right to tempt even ſuch men as you ſpeak of, and that to that degree you mention? and ſo to torment them afterwards? If ever he had ſuch a right (as you ſeem to imply he had) how did he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:111412:100"/> loſe it? what act did he, whereby he deveſted himſelf of it?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer (ſuppoſing that for brevity ſake, which already ſhould have been ſhewed ſomewhat more at large, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Satan,</hi> ſometimes had a right, ſuch as it was, to tempt men, whom, and to what degree he pleaſed, and was able) but my anſwer (I ſay) is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That that right which at any time the <hi>devil</hi> had to tempt men, was but a right of permiſſion, or ſufferance on Gods part: it was not any right the devil could challenge or claim, either by his nature, or birth, or by any heroike, or high-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving action; for the truth is, that that act of the devils, upon the ſucceſſe whereof, God gave him, or rather (to ſpeak warily in a buſineſſe of this nature) ſuffered him to take a right (or rather a power) of tempting men (the tempting of man in Paradiſe) was an act, ſo farre from meriting any thing at the hand of God, that it was highly provoking in his ſight, as may cleerly be gathered from the arraignment of the ſerpent, who was his inſtrument in it <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3.) and the curſe there laid <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note> upon him: yea ſome Divines of great worth and learning, conceive, that the <hi>devils</hi> eternall condemnation was not ſealed, or paſt recovery, till he had added this ſinne, unto his former; brought the creature, man, into an eſtate of miſery and death by his temptation (but this we leave to the aſſertors to prove) So then, that right which the <hi>devil</hi> ever had of tempting men, being nothing elſe but a thing permitted unto him by God, not purchaſed by any deſert of his, but meerly out of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and offence taken at his creature, man; may certainly with righteouſneſſe enough, be taken away by God upon a very ſlender occaſion given on the devils part; yea it may be taken away at pleaſure, without any occaſion at all given by him, from whom it is taken upon ſuch terms. Yea</p>
            <p n="2">2. In as much as this power of tempting men in this life (and there is the ſame reaſon of his power of tormenting them for ever, afterwards) was permitted unto the devil by God, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of diſpleaſure conceived againſt his creature man, and not at all for any gratification of him; whenſoever this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God againſt man ſhall be taken off, and healed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:111412:100"/> (which is done by mans reconcilement to him by faith in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt) there is occaſion and ground enough for God to recall that permiſſion of his given unto the devil; or otherwiſe to limit and reſtrain it, and the exerciſe of it, as he ſhall pleaſe. And in this reſpect it is ſaid of Chriſt that <hi>through death, he deſtroyed him that had the power of death (i.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> had a power permitted unto him, to order and manage the affairs of death, temptations, occaſions, allurements unto ſinne, and all which concern the ſtate, as it were, and kingdom of death, and ſo to execute torments, which may be called, the treaſures of death) <hi>that is, the devil.</hi> Now how did Chriſt <hi>by death, deſtroy him</hi> (in the ſence formerly given) <hi>who had the power of death, the devil?</hi> Doubtleſſe by reconciling the world by it, unto God. For all the right and power the devil had in any conſideration againſt man, being founded (as was ſaid) in that diſpleaſure, which God had conceived againſt him for ſinne; when this diſpleaſure of his ſhall ceaſe and fall, that right and power of the devil ſtanding upon it, muſt needs ceaſe and fall with it. Yet</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) there may be ſomewhat conceived even on the devils part alſo, ſomewhat done by him for which ſuch a deſtruction as we ſpeak of, might juſtly be inflicted by God upon him. Firſt, that power of tempting men, eſpecially the Saints, was forfeited by him, when he preſum'd to tempt him, who was their head; having no right at all, nor colour of right, to be troubleſome to him with any temptation; in as much as he was not in the number of thoſe, with whom God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed for ſinne: and conſequently had no ſufficient ground to think, that God had given him any ſuch permiſſion, to tempt him, as he had to tempt other men. Now we know that an abuſe of a priviledge or power, is (eſpecially ſo notorious, as that of <hi>Satan</hi> was in tempting Chriſt) a juſt cauſe of taking it away from him that abuſeth it.</p>
            <p>There is the ſame conſideration, of the other part of Satans power, I mean his power to torment men after death. His abuſe of this power in procuring the Lord Chriſt to be cut off by a death full of pains and torment, in whom <hi>he had nothing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh 14. 30.</note> (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſaith) <hi>i.</hi> had no ground at all of doing any
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:111412:101"/> thing againſt him, was a juſt ground why he ſhould be deveſted and deſpoiled of it, at leaſt ſo farre, and in reſpect of ſuch perſons, as God ſhould pleaſe to deliver out of his hands. Thus you ſee, that what God doth by a ſtrong hand in deſtroying the <hi>devil,</hi> he is lead unto it in a way of equity and perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. God was not lead hereunto in a way of righteouſneſſe onely, but likewiſe in a way of neceſſity, in relation to that great deſigne of his we oft ſpeak of (the glorifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſalvation and condemnation of men) Firſt, except Satan had been limited and ſtraitned in the exerciſe of that power, which he hath to tempt men; the Saints ſhould have no reſt nor breathing time from his malice in this kinde; he would alwaies be buffeting them, night and day: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they would be in no capacity, never injoy any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, of building up themſelves in their moſt holy faith, nor of preparing or making themſelves meet for their glory: their <hi>ſoul</hi> would be <hi>among lions</hi> continually, and they <hi>lie covered with the ſhadow of death:</hi> they would have enough to doe, yea they would ſuffer ſorely in bearing the devils burthens in this kinde: yea they might be brought to hanging down of hands, and waxing feeble of knees, and to deſpair it ſelf. In a word, as our Saviour ſaith (in reſpect of a temporall preſervation) <hi>that except thoſe daies</hi> (ſpeaking of the miſerable times of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem) be ſhortned, no fleſh can be ſaved;</hi> ſo have we cauſe to <note place="margin">Matth. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> judge and ſay, in reſpect of the eternall preſervation of men; that except Satans power of tempting men had been ſhortned, in an ordinary way and courſe of things, there could <hi>no fleſh,</hi> nor ſpirit neither, have been <hi>ſaved;</hi> at leaſt, not have been ſaved upon thoſe terms of advantage for the glory of God, which now many will (as might be declared more at large; but that we are now upon the ſpeed,) Neither could the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men have taken place, with ſuch advantage for the glory of God, as now it doth, in caſe the <hi>devil</hi> had not been deſtroyed, <hi>i</hi> limited and confined in his tempting power. For the fewer and weaker temptations men are expoſed unto, and tempted with, the more inexcuſable they are if they yield, and quit their loialty and ſubjection unto God. And the more
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:111412:101"/> inexcuſable men are, who are condemned, the more is God glorified in their condemnation: and therefore all things are ſo laid in the counſell of his providence, that they which periſh, ſhall be without <hi>excuſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. Rom. 3. 19. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The caſe is yet more cleer, as concerning his tormenting power. Except he had been deſtroyed in this, the ſalvation of men could have had no place at all. How can thoſe be ſaid to beſaved, who are allwaies expoſed to the tormenting power of the devil? Yea the condemnation it ſelf of men, could not in that degree have abounded to the glory of God, which now it doth. For if Satan had not been deſtroied by Chriſt, in reſpect of this tormenting power of his, there had not been thoſe mighty incouragements and ingagements upon wicked men to beleeve; and conſequently, nothing that ſinne in their non-beleeving. If they had been as obnoxious to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by devil, in caſe they ſhould beleeve, as they could or ſhould have been without beleeving; they had been in a very great meaſure excuſable, above what now they are, in their unbelief. And look in what meaſure or degree men who are condemned, or periſh, are capable of excuſe, the glory of God is ſo much the more obſcure, and leſſe conſpicuous in their condemnation. Thus then ye ſee, in this ſecond particular alſo (the deſtruction of the <hi>devil)</hi> how that forcible power of God which acteth in it, acteth not onely with the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free</hi> conſent of righteouſneſſe, but alſo by the counſell, and at the inſtance of that excellencie of wiſdom, which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd the whole method and means for the glorifying of him, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men. So that all this while we neither ſee, nor hear of any whit more of the arme for the advancement of this great deſigne then is ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and that according to the principles of the moſt exquiſite wiſdom that is.</p>
            <p>The 3. particular, wherein the arme of God comes in, and acts with it's glorious force and might, towards the glorifying of him, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, is the very caſting or forcing of ungodly and impenitent perſons into hell fire; with that which makes way for, and prepares to it, the raiſing them from the dead, and gathering them together before
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:111412:102"/> his judgement ſeat, to receive that diſmall and dreadfull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Goe ye curſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 1. That this act alſo of Gods power, whereby he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wicked and unbeleeving perſons into hell, is led by a fair hand of righteouſneſſe, ſo that there is nothing in it contrary to the greateſt excellencie of wiſdom in that behalf (and there is ever the moſt jealouſie &amp; danger of unrighteouſnes, where there is force and greatnes of power) but that this act of God (I ſay) whereof we now ſpeak, is fully and cleerly righteous, is evident, partly from the demeritoriouſnes or <hi>ſinfulnes</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) <hi>of ſin</hi> in generall; partly (and more particularly) from the demeritoriouſnes of the ſin of unbelief.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>the wages of ſinne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> of ſinne in generall) <hi>is death.</hi> His meaning is, that <hi>death, i.</hi> the eternall ruine, miſery and deſtruction of the creature, is but a ſtipend or conſideration moſt juſtly, due unto, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſin, as wages, or hire for labour, is the moſt juſt and due debt amongſt debts of all kindes, howſoever growing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crueing. There is no more hardneſſe or inequality in it, that God ſhould deſtroy a creture for ever, that hath ſinn'd againſt him, then there is, that a man who hath hired a labourer to work for him, ſhould give him his hire for his work. Though there is not (haply) a greater truth, yet there is a greater plainneſſe and evidence of equity in it, that God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the creature for ſinne, eſpecailly who beleeves not, then that he ſhould ſave him for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, who doth beleeve. <hi>Is God unrighteous</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who puniſheth (viz.</hi> ſinne, or for ſinne) <hi>God forbid.</hi> The meaning of his Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 5.</note> ſeems to be, is God to be thought, or judg'd unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe he puniſheth for ſin? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>q. d.</hi> at no hand: farre be it from us ſo to imagine or think: implying that there is a moſt manifeſt and apparent righteouſneſſe, or equity in it, that God ſhould puniſh or take vengeance, for ſinne; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the thought of his being unrighteous in puniſhing, would not be ſo horrid and abominable.</p>
            <p>Again 2. As ſinne in the generall, or as it is ſinne, be it what kinde of ſinne ſoever, moſt juſtly deſerves death, ſo that God in in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icting death, is no waies unrighteous, oppreſſive, or hard,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:111412:102"/> ſo doth the ſinne of unbelief, in particular, and in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner deſerve death, without which (as we know) no man dieth, or periſheth, for all his other ſinnes. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritoriouſneſſe or ſinfulneſſe of unbelief (and conſequently, the equity of God in infflicting death upon men becauſe of it) conſiſts in the great uncapablenes of it, or (which is much the ſame) the ſtrong and manifeſt oppoſition which it carries in it againſt the grace of God; which appears chiefly in three things. 1. The great and formidable conſequence or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it unto men: 2. In the abundant reaſon which men have ſo to judge and conceive, I mean, that it is of that deep concernment unto them. 3. (And laſtly) in that abundant means which God hath given, or vouchſafed unto men, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or to eſcape all the evil wherewith unbelief (eſpecially in and after death) is accompanied.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We all know, that faith and unbelief, are matters of the higheſt and moſt weighty conſequence of all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever relating to the condition of the creature, man; a great matter of his preſent comfort and diſcomfort, well being, and evil being, depend upon them; but the whole and entire ſumme of his everlaſting condition, his well being, or evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever, depends upon them. <hi>He that beleeves</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhall be ſaved, i.</hi> ſhall be everlaſtingly bleſſed; and <hi>he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that beleeves not (viz.</hi> either ſooner or later, firſt or laſt) <hi>ſhall be damned, i.</hi> everlaſtingly miſerable and accurſed. So that this is cleer: unbelief is, amongſt all the irregularities, unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and miſcarriages of men, of the moſt grievous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable conſequence unto him. As to beleeve is an act of more value, worth, and conſequence unto men, then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vertuous and commendable actions of another kinde; ſo is unbelief, at leaſt continued and perſiſted in unto death: of a thouſand times more ſad and grievous conſequence, then the committing of ten thouſand ſinnes of the greateſt provocation otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I adde further, that men have reaſon in abundance thus to judge and think of it. Firſt, for thoſe that have the letter of the Goſpel, the caſe is more evident. For they have all the reaſon to beleeve this, which they have to beleeve the Goſpel,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:111412:103"/> it ſelf; in as much as the Goſpel doth ſo plainly reveal and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. Now that men have reaſon upon reaſon, reaſon in abundance to beleeve the Goſpel, hath been already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively proved, and may be yet prov'd further. Secondly concerning thoſe, who have onely the heavens, the ſun, moon and ſtarres, and the goodneſſe of God in the government of the world, to preach the Goſpel unto them; theſe alſo have reaſon ſufficient (if not in abundance) to think the ſame thought, and judge the ſame judgement with the other, in the point in hand. For having the Goſpel (I mean, the ſubſtance and effect of it, the willingneſſe and readineſſe of God to be reconciled unto the world) preached unto them by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles aforeſaid, the ſun, moon, ſtarres, the patience, goodneſſe and bountifulneſſe of God in the government of the world (as heretofore hath been declared, and may be further argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in due time) they cannot reaſonably think, but that it is of great weight and moment unto them to beleeve that, which is ſo taught them by ſuch a glorious miniſtry ſent from God. This is one of the moſt common dictates and ſuggeſtions of reaſon; that <hi>Deus &amp; natura nihil faciunt fruſtrà:</hi> God and nature doe nothing in vain, from whence it follows ſemblably, in a way of reaſon; that the greater and more conſiderable any thing is, which God doth, the end depending upon it, or relating to it, and for which it is done, is ſo much the greater, and of the more weight and conſequence. Now that act or work of God, whereby he preacheth the Goſpel (as hath been ſaid) unto all the inhabitants of the earth, cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be looked upon but as a very great and highly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act of his; and ſo the Scriptures from place to place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it to be. If it be ſo, ſo highly conſiderable an act of God to preach the Goſpel unto men in ſuch a way, it follows then, in a way of reaſon, that for men to beleeve or not to beleeve, that which God himſelf preacheth, muſt needs be of very high conſequence and concernment unto them. Becauſe there is no other end (I mean no other immediate and direct end) can reaſonably be imagin'd, which God ſhould propound unto himſelf, in preaching a truth, or a Goſpel, but the beleeving of it by thoſe to whom it is preached. Thus then you ſee the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:111412:103"/> ſecond point cleer alſo: <hi>viz.</hi> that there is ſufficient reaſon and ground, yea indeed reaſon and ground in abundance, why men even heathen men (as we call them) ſhould conceive and judge that the beleeving, or not beleeving of the Goſpel, are things of the greateſt conſequence and importance unto them. And this is another thing which tends to demonſtrate the great demeritoriouſneſſe, or provoking ſinfulneſſe of unbelief: <hi>viz.</hi> the reaſon and means, which men have to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſideration, of the dreadfull conſequence of it. If men had no ground or reaſon at all thus to conceive or judge of it, doubtleſſe the ſinfulneſſe of it would be much eaſed and leſſened thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) Another thing, which in conjunction with the two former, compleats the unmeaſurable <hi>ſinfulneſſe</hi> of the ſinne of unbelief, is, the gracious, liberall and plentifull means, which God hath vouchſafed unto men, to bring them to beleeve, or, to make themſelves beleevers.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe 1. Who have the letter of the Goſpel, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, to reade and to conſider of, they have all thoſe reaſons and grounds, as means enabling them to beleeve, which have been yet inſiſted upon, to prove the originall of the Goſpel to be from God, as being drawn, partly from the ſtile and phraſe, partly from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance of the Goſpel; beſides all thoſe yet remaining of another conſideration, and which are externall, in reſpect of the Goſpel. All which reaſons and grounds diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, amount to a rich and plentifull means, whereby to beleeve. A thouſand things are generally and confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by the world, the truth whereof ſtands upon no ſuch pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of evidence and rationall demonſtration, as the truth of the Goſpel doeth.</p>
            <p>And 2. For thoſe that are without (I mean, without the Goſpel written, or preach'd, upon ſuch terms as it is preached amongſt us daily) they alſo have ſufficient means (if not large and plentifull) for beleeving. <hi>But I demand</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>have they not heard? yes verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their ſound</hi>

(viz.</hi> without admoniſhing and directing them how to walk, and what to doe, after any ſuch manner as now he doth by the letter of the Goſpel ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) what did the <hi>witneſſes</hi> the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, witneſſe concerning God, or, on his behalf? Doubtleſſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:111412:104"/> he doth not ſpeak here of his God-head, nor of his power, nor of his wiſdom, as if his meaning were, that God left not himſelf <hi>without witneſſe</hi> of theſe (though it be true, that he did not leave himſelf without witneſſe, <hi>i.</hi> means of convincing men, of theſe alſo) but the works of creation, as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the works of providence (whereof he here ſpeaks) are ſufficient <hi>witneſſes</hi> of theſe, according to the tenour of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and beſides, there are naturall impreſſions of theſe <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> in the ſpirits and conſciences of men, which are <hi>witneſſes</hi> on Gods behalf thus farre. But doubtleſſe, that in God or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, which the Apoſtle here ſaith, that God intended ſhould be teſtified or witneſſed on his behalf unto men, was ſomewhat more ſecret, more out of the way, as it were, of mens common thoughts or apprehenſions; and particularly it was that gracious and good affection which he bears unto the world through Jeſus Chriſt, his inclination unto peace with men, upon their repentance (which is the ſubſtance of the Goſpel.) This appears 1. by the nature or quality of the witneſſes here ſpoken of, which were, Gods giving men <hi>rain from heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons,</hi> his <hi>filling their hearts with food and gladneſſe.</hi> Such <hi>witneſſes</hi> as theſe, are onely proper to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie grace, and love, and deſire of the good of thoſe, to whom they are given, in him that giveth them. They plainly ſhew, that he that beſtows them, is not extream, uſeth not extremity againſt thoſe that doe amiſſe; and conſequently that he is by one means or other, taken off from the rigour of his juſtice, and ſeverity of his wrath againſt ſinners. And 2. it appears from hence; becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> who was not onely a diligent and faithfull Preacher of the Goſpel where ever he became, but was in ſpeciall manner deſign'd to be an <hi>Apostie to the Gentiles,</hi> preached no other doctrine but this at <hi>Lystra</hi> (a city of the Gentiles) upon that great opportunity that was now offered him. We cannot think that he ſhould only preach a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall or metaphyſicall Sermon, concerning the eſſence or naturall properties of God onely; but that which was Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, and ſavouring of the Goſpel. Now the holy Ghoſt recording either the whole, or (at leaſt) the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he preach'd in this place, reporteth nothing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:111412:105"/> Evangelicall as ſpoken by him, except this be acknowledged for ſuch. So that cleer it is from the Scriptures, that all the world, even thoſe that are moſt ſtraitned and ſcanted in this kinde, thoſe that have not the letter of the Goſpel, have yet ſufficient means of beleeving granted unto them; of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I mean, 1. <hi>that God is, 2. that he is a rewarder of thoſe that deligently ſeek him:</hi> which is all the faith or belief that the Apoſtle makes ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to bring a man unto God, <hi>i.</hi> into grace or favour with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. There are ſeverall other Scriptures that ſpeak home to this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <note place="margin">Heb. 11 6.</note> thoſe argued; particularly, that <hi>Rom. 2. 4. Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long ſuffering,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 2 4.</note> 
               <hi>not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> The <hi>long ſuffering and goodneſſe of God</hi> are ſaid <hi>to lead men to repentance,</hi> becauſe they teſtifie, according to a rationall and cleer interpretation, a willingneſſe and readineſſe in God, to receive all ſuch into grace and favour with himſelf, who ſhall unfainedly repent of their ſinnes. There is no other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but this (at leſt, none without this) in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the <hi>patience</hi> or <hi>bountifulneſſe of God,</hi> can be ſaid <hi>to lead, i.</hi> to perſwade or invite, <hi>to repentance.</hi> There is no motive or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive whereof ſinners are capable <hi>unto repentance,</hi> without hope of pardon upon repentance. But this Scripture we ſhall finde occaſion to argue further ſome other time. In the mean ſeaſon, you ſee it cleer from the Scriptures (and the Scriptures as ye have ſeen, run parallell with evident and cleer reaſon all along in this point) that even heathen men, and thoſe that want the hiſtory of the Goſpel, have yet a ſufficiencie of means whereby to beleeve, and ſo to prevent the wrath and indignation which is to come: in which regard, they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unexcuſable, if they doe it not. We will not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber the tenour of our preſent diſcourſe, with arguing or deciding the queſtion, whether, or how any man can be ſaid to have ſufficient means of beleeving, who doth not actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: this diſpute we ſhall reſpit till ſome better occaſion. In the mean time, moſt certain it is, that they who are deſtroyed and periſh by the hand of God for unbelief, had means, and thoſe ſufficient, whereby to have beleeved; otherwiſe they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:111412:105"/> would not be unexcuſable; no, not though they ſhould be found negligent in improving thoſe means, which they had. For he that certainly knows, that all that ever he can doe, ſhould he put forth himſelf to the uttermoſt, is not able to compaſſe his end; is in a great meaſure excuſable, though he attempts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. But we ſhall not now ſtand upon this. Thus then you have the third and laſt thing, which makes the ſinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, ſo exceedingly ſinfull, ſo abundantly demeritorious as it is; <hi>viz.</hi> the voluntarineſſe of it, men having plentifulneſſe of means vouchſafed from God, to keep themſelves from the defilement of it. Put all the three now together, and you will cleerly ſee the great unworthineſſe and demeritoriouſneſſe of it rifing up from them all jointly. 1. The ſinne of unbelief, is (above all ſinnes whatſoever) of the moſt diſmall and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſequence unto men. 2. There is light enough for men, to come to the cleer knowledge of it, I mean that it is of that dreadfull conſequence. 3. (And laſtly) men have a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of means, a price put into their hand, wherewith to redeem themſelves out of the hand of it. Now then that man or that woman, that in the face of three ſuch conſiderations as theſe, ſhall either ſit ſtill, or quit themſelves but looſly and careleſly to recover their ſouls out of the ſnare of unbelief, commit a ſinne (doubtleſſe) of the greateſt and moſt deſperate oppoſition to all principles of reaſon that can be; and conſequently, a ſin of the greateſt demerit, and higheſt provocation, in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, what between the demerit of ſinne in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (I mean, of all other ſinnes wherewith men defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) and the great demerit of unbelief in particular, the righteouſneſſe of God in puniſhing and deſtroying wicked and ungodly men, <hi>appears in perfect beauty:</hi> there is nothing hard, nothing unequall in it: yea there is nothing in it, but what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the wiſdom of God it ſelf, as well as his righteouſneſſe, or perfect hatred of ſinne. For as it would be an unſavoury thing, and contrary, as well to principles of wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as of juſtice, in a civil magiſtrate that bears the ſword, and tending to his great diſparagement and diſhonour, if either he ſhould not puniſh thoſe that tranſgreſſe the laws, which he is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:111412:106"/> to execute, or if he ſhould puniſh them with puniſhments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable, and unproportioned to their offences, whether on the right hand, or on the left: in like manner, it would reflect diſhonour upon the ever bleſſed and glorious name of God (and ſo be contrary to the excellencie of wiſdom) if he ſhould either not puniſh wicked and ungodly men, the tranſgreſſours of his law, at all; or if he ſhould puniſh them, and not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies (at leaſt) proportion both the nature, and degree of their puniſhment, to their ſinne. So that all things conſidered, this act alſo of the powerfull arme of God, whereby he caſts ſinners into hell, is no more then what neceſſity requires of him; is an act as well of righteouſneſſe and of wiſdom, as of power.</p>
            <p>The 4. and laſt great act of the power of God to be put forth and exerciſed in bringing about that great deſigne we have oft mentioned (the glorifying of himſelf in the ſalvation and condemnation of men) is that whereby the Saints ſhall be advanced, or put into an actuall poſſeſſion of their glory, with all things requiſite hereunto, as the <hi>raiſing of them from the dead,</hi> the <hi>changing of their vile bodies,</hi> &amp;c. Now that this act alſo of his power is drawn forth by principles of reaſon, equity, and of the moſt excellent wiſdom, is evident thus; by theſe and ſuch like conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God ſhould reward his friends and faithfull ſervants that have done his will and ſought his glory (as the Saints have done) is reaſonable and equall in the eyes of all fleſh: ſuch an act as this, is no waies obnoxious to any ill reſentment, or interpretation whatſoever. Nay if God ſhould not doe it, there are thouſands of his creatures that ſhould (in ſuch a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) be more excellent then he. There is no man of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and that ſavours the things of his honour, but that will remember and conſider proportionably to his power, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of friends and ſervants ſhewed unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When men have erected and ſet up any kinde of exerciſe, or tryall of maſteries, as by running, wraſtling, or the like, and have made their orders and laws for thoſe that ſhall exerciſe, and thus have drawn men of activity and worth in that kinde from ſeverall parts, to try their ſtrength and activeneſſe, by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:111412:106"/> ingaging themſelves in the exerciſe; it is but reaſon and equity, that he that ſtriveth, and <hi>ſtriveth lawfully</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>i.</hi> obſerving all the laws and orders of the exerciſe, and overcoming, ſhould be crowned, or receive the <hi>bravium,</hi> or price, that is held forth, for the conquerour. Now God in the Goſpel propounds (as it were) a noble exerciſe of faith and holineſſe; he hath appointed his laws and orders for this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; he hath deſigned a crown of life, and of immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to thoſe that ſhall overcome; he draws perſons from all quarters of the world, whoſe hearts will ſerve them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in his exerciſe. Now then it is but juſt and reaſonable, that thoſe that doe ſtrive, and <hi>ſtrive lawfully,</hi> and overcome, ſhould receive the reward that is promiſed, and conſequently ſhould be by a ſtrong hand put into poſſeſſion of eternall life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When ſouldiers have ſtood by their Generall, induced much hardſhip, and ventured their lives with him, and for him, in any hard and hot ſervice; in caſe the day goes on their ſide, and their Generall triumphs, it is but equall that ſuch ſouldiers ſhould partake according to their meaſure, of the joy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the triumph with him. Now the Saints are good ſouldiers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> they ſtand by him in this preſent world: they undergoe much handſhip from the world for his ſake; they are partakers with him of his ſufferings, as well by mortification, as by perſecutions by men; therefore Jeſus Chriſt himſelf triumphing in eternity of life and glory, it is but equall that they ſhould partake of the ſame triumph with him. This the Scripture it ſelf acknowledgeth for equall. <hi>Now if we be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6 8.</note> 
               <hi>dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> We beleeve, <hi>i.</hi> we have cauſe or reaſon to beleeve it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of the equitableneſſe of it. So in another place: <hi>If we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him: if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>reign with him.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not argue theſe conſequences (as he doth many others) becauſe they are ſo naturall, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in, and of, themſelves. Yet</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, there is not onely an equitableneſſe in the thing (I mean, that the Saints ſhall be highly honoured by God) but there is an excellencie of wiſdom in it alſo, yea that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:111412:107"/> they ſhould be honoured with the height of honour, that (according to the Goſpel) ſhall be conferred and caſt upon them by God; and that in a double conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe great and excellent recompences and rewards given by men for ſervices done unto them, being within the compaſſe of their means, or abilities to give, without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible prejudice to their eſtates, are much for their honour, and for the advancement of their intereſts in the opinions and eſtimations of men. A great and bountifull reward, is a kinde of artificiall and pleaſant picture of a mans worth, drawn by himſelf, or with his own hand. For he that is liberall in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing ſervices done unto him, ſeems to be conſcious of ſome ſpeciall worth in himſelf; and that which he doth in this caſe, above the uſuall rate of others, to doe out of conſcience; as conceiving, that he that hath done any good office to him, hath done a better deed, and ſo deſerves a better reward, then if he had done the ſame, yea or a greater, to another man. For certainly to ſave the life of a good man, and who is like to be a benefactour unto many, is a better act, and more worthy a reward, then the ſaving of the life of an ordinary, or unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving man: and ſo it is proportionably in other ſervices done, or to be done reſpectively, to ſuch perſons: whereas ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who having means and opportunity to deal bountifully by thoſe that ſerve them, and yet ſhould reward them poorly; they doe by ſuch ſparingneſſe (in effect) acknowledging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be perſons of little worth or value; and that they that ſerved them, had done onely that which was next to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and therefore a ſlender conſideration was reward enough for them. So then the great and glorious God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding thoſe that have ſerved him, with crowns and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the great things of eternity, draws, as it were, a lively and happy portraicture of his own infinite worth and goodneſſe; and declares in the ſight of heaven and earth, and hell, at what an high rate he values himſelf, and his own glory, by ſhewing himſelf ſo above meaſure bountifull unto thoſe that ſerve him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There lay a neceſſity upon God to lift up his Saints as high in bleſſedneſſe and glory, as now he intends to doe, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:111412:107"/> reſpect of that foundation, which he hath laid to build this fabrique or building upon, I mean his onely begotten Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that ſo there might be a comlineſſe of proportion, a correſpondencie, between the foundation, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, or that which is built upon it. If men ſhall lay either ſilver or gold, or precious ſtones for their foundation, and build nothing but a little hay, or ſtubble, or wood upon it, would not all men laugh at them (as our Saviour ſpeaks in a caſe not much unlike) and ſay; they <hi>began</hi> gloriouſly, but they <hi>finiſh</hi> ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. So, God having laid the foundations of the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Saints, in his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and in his bloud (as indeed he had none other foundation to lay for that building) if he ſhould not build ſomewhat proportionably thereunto, the glory of the foundation would be a ſhame and diſhonour to the reſt of the work, and ſwallow up all the beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie thereof. The truth is, that (to ſpeak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in ſome caſes) God will have much adoe to finde materialls, ſtones ſumptuous or magnificent enough, either in heaven or in earth, or in all his dominions, to build up the glory of the Saints, upon any ſuch terms, but that the glory of the foundation will be a kinde of overſhadowing to it, when he hath done. In other buildings the ſuperſtructure ſometimes chargeth, and overchargeth the foundation: but in this building we ſpeak of, it rather is, and will be contrary; the foundation is, and will be, too weighty in glory for the ſuperſtruction; yea though this be as weighty in glory, as glory it ſelf can make. <hi>For even that which was made glorious</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the miniſtration of the law) <hi>had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory which excelleth</hi> (meaning, in the miniſtration of the Goſpel.) In like manner, though the bleſſedneſſe, which ſhall be veſted in the Saints, ſhall be glorious, yea excellently glorious, in it ſelf; yet being compared with that exceſſe and ſuper-abundance of glory in the foundation, there will be found as little glory in it, as could reaſonbaly be expected; though as much alſo, as the capacity of the ſubjects will well bear. And therefore to be ſure, the wiſdom of God (mark, I doe not the goodneſſe, the love, the bounty of God, or the like, but) the wiſdom of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:111412:108"/> God will put him upon ſearching out whatſoever is rich, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is precious, whatſoever is excellent, whatſoever is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, whatſoever hath the leaſt ingredience of happineſſe in it, whether in heaven or in earth, to build up the bleſſedneſſe of his Saints with, to ſalve, as it were, it's own glory. Conſider whether that of the Apoſtle doth not riſe as high as all this: <hi>He that ſpared not his own ſon, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall be not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
               <hi>How ſhall he not,</hi> &amp;c. is marveilouſly emphaticall and concluſive. It is as if he had ſaid; If we doe but grant or ſuppoſe, that God hath given up his Sonne unto death for our ſakes, and for our good; we cannot reaſonably imagine, ſhould we ſtudy never ſo ſeriouſly, with never ſo much intenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde and thought, to raiſe and form ſuch an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation within us, how it is poſſible, or any waies conſiſtent with the wiſdom of God, to give us any thing leſſe then <hi>all things,</hi> for the compleating of our happineſſe. Thus we have ſhewed you how that all that power, all thoſe acts of power to be performed by God, within the compaſſe of that means, or any part of that means, which he hath projected for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, are both all clothed with wiſdom, and that they are no more, none other, then what are ſimply neceſſary to the accompliſhment of his end.</p>
            <p>We ſignified unto you (in the ſecond place) that all other parts or ingredients in the means we ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> which doe not ſtand in any executive force or power, but in a ſimple cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement, doe in the eye of reaſon, and of a conſiderate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, look with a very pleaſant, delightfull, yea with a divine aſpect, upon the great end, ſo oft, and lately mentioned. To take all particulars in this kinde into conſideration, would be a long work, and require much time, and (I fear) prove weariſome unto you. We ſhall onely touch ſome of the moſt conſiderable of them. Gods end being (as hath been ſtill ſaid, and once proved) the glorifying of himſelf like himſelf, in the ſalvation and condemnation of men, it was neceſſary for him ſo to provide for the effecting of the one, and ſo to make way for the execution of the other, not onely that none
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:111412:108"/> of his glorious attributes or perfections might ſuffer, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged in either; but that by means of the one and the other jointly taken, the glory of them (I mean of thoſe attributes of his) might be diſcovered and made known, and that to an excellent degree of manifeſtation. For the bringing to paſſe the former of theſe (the ſalvation of men) upon the terms mentioned; three things were neceſſary for God to doe (in the generall: the two former whereof make way likewiſe for the latter, I mean, the glorifying of himſelf like himſelf in the condemnation of men.) But it was neceſſary (I ſay) for God, in reference to both theſe great tranſactions, as well the ſalvation, as condemnation of men. 1. To put himſelf into an honourable capacity of treating with man about the great things of his ſalvation. 2. To make him capable of ſuch terms, upon which he might, with the ſafety of his own glory, ſave him. 3. (and laſtly) If he meant to make ſure work of the ſalvation of man, it was further neceſſary for him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, not onely that men might be capable of thoſe terms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he might honourably ſave them, but that they ſhould actually yield unto, and accept of them. In all theſe you ſhall ſee ſtrains of wiſdom indeed, ſuch as are enough to make all the wiſdom under heaven abaſed.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe: Neceſſary (I ſay) it was that God ſhould put himſelf into an honourable capacity of treating with man about his ſalvation. For man being a traytour and a rebell, by reaſon of ſinne committed againſt him, and ſo ſtanding as a guilty perſon before him worthy of death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, unholy, unrighteous; it was no waies agreeable with the infinite holineſſe and purity of Gods nature, and that diſtrict ſeverity againſt ſinne, which is in him, to fall immediately, and without any conſideration at all intervening, upon a treaty with him, about the great affair of his ſalvation and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though it's true, he might have ſaved men without any preceeding treaty with them about it; yet he could not have glorified himſelf in this ſalvation of theirs, upon thoſe rich terms, which now, as he hath contrived matters in order thereunto, he may, and will doe. It is a ſaying in naturall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, that <hi>natura non conjungit extremae, niſi per media:</hi> and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:111412:109"/> again, that <hi>natura non facit ſaltum.</hi> i. <hi>nature, [i.</hi> God, in the courſe of nature] <hi>is not wont to join extreams together, but by ſomewhat of a middle nature between them:</hi> and again, <hi>nature doth not leap.</hi> Nor would it have ſtood with the wiſdom of God, conſidering the infinite holineſſe of his nature, and the tranſcendent excellencie of his majeſty and glory, to have clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in ſuch a treatiſe as we ſpeak of, with that polluted and imbaſed duſt and aſhes, called man, after that grand rebellion of his, without ſome mediatory conſideration or other, yea and that of ſuch weight, which might render this act of his, in treating with ſuch a creature, every waies honourable to him. Now what other conſideration can there be imagined, ſo proper and full, to juſtifie the glorious God in admitting that moſt unworthy creature of his, man, to a treaty of grace with himſelf, as that his own Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be made man, and in this nature of man, ſuffer death, and that by way of atonement, for the ſinne of man? Now to judge (in part) of the proportion or meetneſſe of the conſideration we ſpeak of, for that great end and purpoſe mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the making way, and that with honour, for God to condeſcend to a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treaty, with his guilty and ſinfull creature, man, we muſt conceive after this manner. Suppoſe a ſubject or perſon of mean quality hath injured and provoked his Prince, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be ſuppoſed never ſo great, and the provocation never ſo deep and juſt, yet in caſe any thing ſhall be done by any of the kindred of him, that hath ſo injured this Prince, and in relation to his offence, every waies as valuable for the accommodating, or repairing the honour, or to the benefit of the Prince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as the injury or provocation was in diſhonour or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in any kinde unto him, this Prince hath now a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before him, upon which with the ſafety of his honour (I mean, even as men count honour) he may ſend to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his, and be ſo farre pacified towards him, as to treat with him, and offer him conditions of pardon and reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe in this caſe he is no looſer by him; and if he will be perſwaded to change his minde, and to vow loyalty, and love, and faithfulneſſe unto him, he hath honourable grounds to forgive him, and to be friendly unto him afterwards. In
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:111412:109"/> like manner, God having received that ſervice and that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the hand of ſuch a perſon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is, being of the nature or kindred of man, and that in relation to the ſinne and provocation of man, which is every waies as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in matter of glory to him, as the ſinne of man was in diſhonour and provocation; he may upon this conſideration, without the leaſt touch of diſparagement to his holineſſe, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wiſdom, or any other attribute whatſoever, offer terms of reconciliation and peace, to him that hath provoked him. The reaſon is, becauſe now he is no looſer by him: and therefore if he will be perſwaded and won by offers and terms of grace, ſuch as are meet for God to offer, to change his minde, and to ſwear homage and fealty, love and faithfulneſſe unto him for the future, he is at perfect liberty to receive him unto grace and favour; and to doe further unto him whatſoever his ſoul deſireth, in any way of goodneſſe and bounty. Not as if God were bound, preſently to forgive men their ſins, and to take them into his ſpeciall favour, upon what, or, becauſe of what Chriſt hath done, or ſuffered for them (which ſeems to be the ſence of many) no, Chriſt did not ſatisfie for any mans ſinnes in ſuch a ſence, or upon ſuch terms. But therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have ſatisfied for the ſins of men, or (which is the ſame, in Scripture, and therefore in better and more proper, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) to have made an atonement for men, or for the ſins of men, becauſe he hath ſo farre pacified and reconciled God unto the world, that he is willing, not withſtanding their great ſinne, and unworthineſſe, and affront put upon him, to beat a parley, and to condeſcend to offer propoſitions and terms of life and peace unto men; yet ſo, that they who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend (or rather indeed, that will not aſcend) firſt or laſt, to the conditions and terms offered by him, <hi>i.</hi> that will not beleeve, ſhall have no further benefit, by any thing he hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done or ſuffered for them. Nor will it follow, that they for whoſe ſinnes Chriſt hath ſatisfied, muſt needs by vertue of this ſatisfaction, be preſently juſtified, and ſaved; or, that God otherwiſe ſhould be unjuſt, <hi>viz.</hi> if having received ſatisfaction, he ſhould condemn men for thoſe ſinnes, for which he hath been ſatisfied. The reaſon is becauſe the ſatisfaction of Chriſt,

Now the Scriptures are very cleer and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this, that the ſatisfaction, and ſufferings of Chriſt, doe not juſtifie or ſave any man ſimply, or by themſelves, but by and through a mans beleeving, as on the contrary, that they are ſatisfactory and juſtificatory in abundance, to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in caſe they ſhall beleeve. <hi>So God loved the world</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son;</hi> not <note place="margin">Ioh 3. 16</note> ſimply that men, or any man <hi>ſhould have everlasting life by him;</hi> but that <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If it be objected; but if men be not completely juſtified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or by the ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt</hi> without beleeving, then beleeving adds ſomewhat to Chriſt, or to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; makes this efficacious unto juſtification, which (it ſeems) in it ſelf is weak. I anſwer (briefly.)</p>
            <p>No; Faith doth not adde in the leaſt to the nature, value,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:111412:111"/> or efficacie of Chriſts ſatisfaction, it onely interreſſeth men in the value and efficacie of it; both which were in it in as ample and full meaſure, before men beleeve, as they are after. The fire whilſt a man keeps at a diſtance from it, doth not warm him, when he comes neer it, it doth: yet his coming neer, doth not make the fire any whit hotter, then it was before; onely it gives him intereſt and communion in the heat of it, which he had not before. So the applying of a plaſter to a ſore, doth not adde any healing vertue to it, nor make it any whit more healing in the nature of it, then it was before; onely it inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſeth him, that hath the ſore to which it is applied, in that healing vertue which it had, before it was applied. Thus then you ſee how mens ſins may be ſaid to be fully ſatisfied for, and atoned by Chriſt, yea as fully as it is poſſible for them to be; and yet men remain under the guilt of them, and periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly becauſe of them, and that without the leaſt touch or ſhadow of diſparagement to the juſtice of God. But we may have occaſion to ſpeak further into this point ſome other time: where we may further cleer the difficulty; how it may ſtand with the juſtice of God to accept Chriſts ſatisfaction for the ſins of men, and yet deſtroy men for them notwithſtanding: and indeed it is a point well worth our inquiring into; becauſe generally we doe not underſtand the counſel and minde of God in it aright. If we did, it would ſet us at perfect liberty from ſome of the moſt enſnaring intanglements in the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian way; and quite break the credit thereof: and the very truth is, that Antinomianiſme (as we call it) is nothing elſe, but a ſyſteme or body of the due and lawfull conſequences of their opinions, who moſt fiercely oppoſe it. But this onely by the way.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee, as to the firſt of the three particulars men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, how God hath put himſelf into an honourable capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of treating with men, though vile, ſinnefull, and rebellious, about the great things of their ſalvation, by giving his own Son, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be made man, and by gaining his conſent, in this nature, to make an atonement by his death for their ſinnes. And the truth is that there was no other way or means for him to doe this (or at leaſt none like unto it) but that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:111412:112"/> which hath been declared, nor was it (as hath been ſaid) for the glory of God to have done it, to have ſaved men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by way of treaty firſt had with them; as might be ſhewed at large, if it were neceſſary; The Apoſtle himſelf implies as much, as all that hath been ſaid in the point hitherto, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. ſaying, <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of wickedneſſe and rebellion againſt him, and ſo put them into heaven: no, his method and deſigne was, firſt, to ſlay that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in their natures againſt him, and to reduce them to terms of friendſhip and love; which was neceſſary to be done by a way of treaty and capitulation with them in this world. But ſecondly, how or which way ſhould God come at a treaty with man, with honour? It was not (as we ſaid) agreeable to the infinite holineſſe of his nature, or greatneſſe of his majeſty (nor did his wiſdom ſo apprehend it) to offer treaty or terms of peace unto man being in actuall rebellion againſt him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome conſideration mediating and leading thereunto, and that ſuch as was meet to ſway in a buſineſſe of that high and great import. Nor indeed was he as yet provided of ſuch terms, or capable of making ſuch propoſitions or offers unto man, which were like to take with him, or to bring him over in love unto him. How then did he goe to work? what did he, to prepare himſelf a way, to treat with his wretched creature, man, with honour? <hi>He was in Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) he went, and got, or put himſelf into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> [God and man] having firſt contrived and diſpoſed of him for the purpoſe, <hi>i.</hi> prevailed with him, after a few years ſpent holily and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly in the fleſh, to yield to die for the ſins of men. Now God having thus put himſelf, as it were, in Chriſt, thus prepared and wrought for his deſigne, being now provided for a treaty, in him he comes forth, invites the world to a treaty, and offers ſuch rich and gracious terms of love and peace, which are moſt effectuall and likely to take the world off from their hatred
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:111412:112"/> and enmity againſt him, and to bring men over unto him in love, and with all affections of loyalty and honour. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf;</hi> but how? by what engine doth God attempt ſuch a piece as this? by <hi>not imputing their ſinnes</hi> [or treſpaſſes] <hi>unto them</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>i.</hi> by propoſing and promiſing unto them a free pardon of all their ſinnes, with all the rich and bleſſed conſequents of ſuch a grace as this is, as purchaſed by Chriſt, and ready for them, if they will but love him, and diſavow and abandon, that ſinfulneſſe in their hearts and lives, which are enmity to him. Now the glorious God, though he hath an heart infinitely larger then the ſand upon the ſea ſhore (which was the meaſure of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 King 4. 29.</note> wiſdom) my meaning is, though he be infinite in wiſdom, yet doubtleſſe he hath not another word to ſpeak unto the heart of the world, ſo proper, or ſo effectuall for the gaining in, and <hi>reconciling the world</hi> unto himſelf, as this; that their ſinnes are pardoned, and ſhall never <hi>be imputed</hi> unto them, if they will beleeve. The root of all that hatred and enmity which is in the natures of men againſt God, is the want of a ſence of that love of God towards them, which he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſted, by providing for them free pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of all their ſinnes, if they will but accept of it. Make men but truly apprehenſive and ſenſible of this, and you ſhall without any more adoe <hi>reconcile them unto</hi> God, and heal that root of bitterneſſe, I mean that hatred and enmity againſt him, which is in them.</p>
            <p>Now in the preparation unto, and carriage of this great tranſaction of God deſcribed and opened unto you from the Scriptures, his putting himſelf (as I call it) into an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable capacity of treating with his creature, man, there are many particular ſtreins and paſſages of an excellencie of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the conſideration whereof would require much more time, then I beleeve you would willingly allow upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; as about the incarnation, conception, birth, circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, baptiſme, the life, death, reſurrection, aſcention of Jeſus Chriſt; the carriage of all which in that variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which the Goſpel relates, is full of wiſdom, and looks with a very pleaſing face in them all upon that great and bleſſed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:111412:113"/> tranſaction we ſpeak of, the treaty which God hath at this day on foot with the world, about the great things of their peace: But we muſt not now inſiſt upon any of them. Again</p>

               </gap> ſpecified, for God to put himſelf into an honourable capacity of treating with his creature about matters of ſalvation; ſo was it no leſſe neceſſary for him, to make this creature of his, capable of ſuch terms, I mean of yielding or condeſcending to ſuch terms, upon which God might not onely with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but with the advancement of his own glory, ſave him, in caſe he accepts of them; or otherwiſe condemn him, if he rejects them. If you ask me, 1. What are the terms, which the creature muſt be made capable of, that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified like himſelf, either in the ſalvation, or condemnation of it; I anſwer, the terms are, only beleeving in God through Jeſus Chriſt with a ſaith unſeigned, and which works by love: the creature muſt be made capable hereof, that God may be glorifyed, either in his ſalvation, or condemnation.</p>
            <p>If you ask me in the ſecond place) but what neceſſity is there, that the creature ſhould be made capable of theſe terms, that God may be glorifyed in his condemnation? We grant it neceſſary, in reſpect of his being glorifyed in his ſalvation, but we conceive no neceſſity of Gods glory, in his condemnation.</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly (for the preſent, hoping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re long to give you a further account of what I ſhall now ſay) there is this neceſſity of it: if God ſhould not make men capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, I mean, indue men with ſuch principles, abilities, or guifts, of reaſon, judgement, memory, underſtanding, by the diligent improvement whereof they might come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, of a willingneſſe or readineſſe in him to receive them into grace and favour, upon their repentance and turning to him (upon which conviction, that repentance and turning unto God we ſpeak of, alwaies follows) they which are condemned would have their mouths open againſt Gods proceedings with them thereunto, and furniſhed with an excuſe. Now look whatſoever men ſhall be able with reaſon to ſay for themſelves,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:111412:113"/> or in their own defence, why they ſhould not be condemned; it will be ſo much out of the way of the glory of God, in their condemnation, in caſe he ſhould condemn them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture tells us, that God hath dealt ſo with men, and means to doe ſo ſtill, that if they be condemned, their mouthes ſhall be ſtopped, and all manner of excuſe taken from them. <hi>For the inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are cleerly ſeen being underſtood by the things that are</hi>

            <p>Beſides, if God ſhould offer and promiſe unto men life and peace and ſalvation (as we know he doth to thouſands, who never accept of his offer, and ſo periſh everlaſtingly) yea and preſſe upon them with many expreſſions of love, tenderneſſe, and great compaſſions, even <hi>beſeeching them</hi> by his Miniſters (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>that they would be reconciled unto him,</hi> having taken away (though juſtly) that power from them, whereby they might have been able to have done themſelves good by accepting thoſe offers of grace, if ti had not been

It were eaſie to ſhew many other neceſſities, beſides theſe, which lay before God to render men capable of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or aſſenting unto his propoſitions and terms of grace, if he meant to glorifie himſelf like himſelf, in their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the fuller examination of this buſineſſe we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to a further occaſion: where we ſhall anſwer likewiſe the objections uſually brought againſt it. As to that objection wherewith this opinion (perhaps) is burthened in the thoughts of many, as <hi>viz.</hi> that it is an <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains free-will, with the like: we ſhall anſwer no more for the preſent, but this; that if it be a doctrine aſſerted by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (as moſt aſſuredly it is) it ought to ſuffer no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for being found amongſt the tenets of <hi>Arminius. It is a faithfull ſaying,</hi> and never the leſſe <hi>worthy all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> though it was (in effect, and for ſubſtance) the ſaying, and ſence of the devil, when he affirmed <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> to be <hi>the holy one of God, Mark</hi> 1. 24. But it is a common Papiſticall trick, to nick-name truths and opinions, which riſe up againſt the intereſts and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:111412:114"/> honour of the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to bethink themſelves of ſome heretike or other, who aſſerted them. And I wiſh that too many of thoſe who are called Proteſtants, and who as ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as they, affect the name of Orthodox, did not too much <hi>praiſe ſuch their ſayings,</hi> by a frequent imitation of them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the excellencie of wiſdom in God is highly conſiderable, in framing and tempering a creature, ſo, which ſhall be indued with a ſufficiencie of ſtrength and power to beleeve, and yet this ſtrength and power notwithſtanding, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall, never will beleeve, without a further ſupply from God; yea and this as certainly in the eye and knowledge of God, as if he had deprived him of, or denied unto him, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtrength and power to beleeve. And yet we have an inſtance or example of this wiſdom in God, we ſpeak of, in the framing of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and that by the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all Divines, as well Proteſtants, as Papiſts; all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that <hi>Adam</hi> received from the hand of his bountifull creatour a ſufficiencie of power, or ſpirituall ſtrength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to have ſtood, and made good the poſſeſſion of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, againſt all aſſaults and temptations whatſoever, had he pleaſed to have improved the ſame accordingly; and yet that God did withall fore-ſee that he would fall, and that with as much certainty and infallibility of knowledge, as if there had been a neceſſity of his falling, and he inveſted with no poſſibility, or ſufficiencie of power, whereby to ſtand.</p>
            <p>The third (and laſt) particular mentioned was, that if God meant to make ſure work of the ſalvation of men (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did) and withall to make earnings of glory to himſelf, in, or out of their ſalvation, it was ſimply neceſſary for him, to provide, not onely that men might be capable of thoſe terms, upon which he might with the ſafety, yea and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his own glory, ſave them, but alſo that they might and ſhould, actually yield unto, and accept of them; yea and that with certainty, and infallibly, and yet without any inforcement, compulſion, or conſtraint, or otherwiſe, then by opening the eies of their mindes and underſtandings, to ſee,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:111412:115"/> apprehend, and conſider thoſe things, which ſhould effectually incline their hearts to yield up themſelves unto God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Now that God, according to the tenour and current of the Goſpel, hath made ſuch a proviſion as this, cannot l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghtly be unknown unto thoſe, who are ſo much as compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently acquainted therewith. When the Lord informed <hi>Paul</hi> by a viſion in the night that <hi>he had much people in the city of Carinah,</hi> his meaning doubtleſſe) was, that he had many ſouls there, to whom he intended the grace of faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and that by the Miniſtry of <hi>Paul:</hi> yet <hi>Pauls</hi> way and method of converting ſouls to the faith, was none other, but by <hi>opening their eyes, and turning them from darkneſſe unto light, and</hi> [hereby] <hi>from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 6. (to paſſe by other places without number of like import.) But into this point we may have opportunity other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe further to inquire.</p>
            <p>Thus we have found the third character or property we mentioned of an excellencie of wiſdom, fairly ſtamped upon the Goſpel; fully appearing in that deviſe, that glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of God, to glorifie himſelf in the ſalvation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men. There remains onely the fourth and the laſt character of this wiſdom, which we ſhall now briefly open unto you; and ſhew it you in the Goſpel alſo.</p>
            <p>This character or property, we ſaid was a certain myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the means, which ſhall at any time be levied and advanced for the bringing of ſome great end to paſſe: when the modell and whole projection thereof is of ſuch a nature and contrivance, that it doth not ſympathize with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary projections of men; is of ſuch a ſtrain and carriage, that the reaſons and underſtandings of men, when they come to apprehend it, are ready to fall down before it, to admire, and adore the rarity of it; and to confeſſe and ſay concerning it, that according to the rate of their ſpeculations and workings, they ſhould never have come neer it; it lies a thouſand degrees beyond the line of all thoſe diſcoveries, which they had been ever like to make. Now that the means which the Goſpel holds forth, for the effecting of that great end (ſo oft named) is of this nature, myſterious in this ſence which hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:111412:115"/> is evident, and that in reſpect of ſundry particulars, and veins (as it were) of diſpenſation, running along in the body of it. We ſhall inſiſt only upon that, which is the very baſis or foundation of the whole work; the incarnation of the ſon of God. This is myſtery upon myſtery, and all is myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Who would ever have ſaid to Abraham</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sarah) that Sarah ſhould give children ſuck?</hi> But how many thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who would ever have ſaid unto the world, that the Son of God ſhould become the ſon of man, and <hi>dwell in a tabernacle of fleſh,</hi> to give ſalvation to it? There are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things relating unto, and depending upon this incarnation of the Son of God, which are all myſterious (in the ſence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) Firſt, that God ſhould have a Son, conſubſtantiall and coeſſentiall with him, and yet perſonally diſtinct from him, is a great myſtery it ſelf; <hi>i.</hi> is a concluſion or truth, which all the ſagacity and quickneſſe of all the reaſon and underſtanding of men under heaven, was not likely to have brought out of that darkneſſe, wherein it is hid, into the light; had it not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and that in viſions of the noone day, from heaven: yea, notwithſtanding that cleer and perfect revelation which is now made of it from heaven, yet how many thouſands have there been, and are at this day, not onely of Heathens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels who reject the whole body of the Scriptures, but even of thoſe, who have ſubſcribed unto the truth of the Scriptures, as being from God (I ſay) many thouſands of theſe, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, men of great abilities, parts, and learning, have not acknowledged this for a truth, that God hath any ſuch Son as we ſpeak of, who is conſubſtantiall, with him; For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him whom the Scriptures hold forth under this relation, <hi>viz.</hi> as being the naturall or conſubſtantiall Son of God, to be any ſuch ſon of his; they muſt needs be ſuppoſed to deny, the being of any ſuch ſonne at all; this being the main why they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:111412:116"/> deny <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God (in any ſuch ſence) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they cannot, or at leaſt doe not, conceive, that there is any place or poſſibility for God to have any ſuch Son. And this ſhews the truth, or concluſion we ſpeak of, to be very myſterious; <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath a ſon coeſſentiall and conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Son of God (ſuppoſing his being) ſhould come to be incarnate, or <hi>made fleſh</hi> (as the Scripture expreſſion is) is <hi>without controverſie</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>a great myſtery</hi> alſo, <hi>i.</hi> ſuch a diſpenſation, or tranſaction, as the thoughts of men, had they been all ingaged for a thouſand years together, compaſſing heaven and earth with inquiries after truth, or probabilities of things, would in all likelyhood never have come neer, nor ſo much as look towards it: and that in regard of theſe two conſiderations. 1. The manner or ſtrangeneſſe of the way, or means, how it ſhould be done. 2. The ſtrangeneſſe of the grace, or condeſcention in the Son of God to doe it, or to ſuffer it to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The reaſon or thoughts of man would never have expected, or thought of the perſonall uniting of the Son of God, and the nature of man, in regard of the ſtrangeneſſe of the way, or means how ſuch an union as this ſhould, and muſt be effected: as a man would never expect or think that the reaſonable ſoul of a man ſhould be perſonally united to the body of a piſmire or flie, becauſe the means how it ſhould come to be thus united is very difficult to be conceived. The unlikelyhood of means, whereby any thing is to be brought to paſſe, and muſt be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if ever it takes place, is very apt, eſpecially if it be great, and drawing neer to a ſuppoſed impoſſibility, to turn men aſide, and take them off from all expectation, yea and thought, that ever the thing ſhould be effected. What was the reaſon that made <hi>Sarah</hi> to conceive, and ſpeak (as we heard, ſhe did) <hi>viz</hi> that no man <hi>would ever have ſaid unto Abraham (viz.</hi> as being a thing no waies likely to come to paſſe) <hi>that Sarah ſhould give children ſuck in her old daies?</hi> Doubtleſſe her reaſon was, becauſe ſhe thought there was no probable means that any man would apprehend or think upon, how ſhe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and bring forth children, after is had <hi>ceaſed to be with her
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:111412:116"/> after the manner of women.</hi> So what was it, that turned the thoughts and expectations of that noble man aſide, on whoſe hand the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> leaned, from the fulfilling, or taking place of what the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> had prophecied, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">2 King 7. 1.</note> he had the advantage of this Prophets word and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to keep them to it; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>by tomorrow, a meaſure of fine ſlower ſhould be ſold for a ſhekel, and two meaſures of barley for a ſhekel in the gates of Samaria?</hi> what was that (I ſay) that took off this noble man from all expectation or thinking that any ſuch thing would be? but onely that there was no means in his eye likely to bring it to paſſe, as is evident, <hi>verſ. 2. Though the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would make windows in the heavens, could</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>this thing come to paſſe?</hi> In like manner, if there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the way, to put the incarnation of the Son of God quite out of all the thoughts, and clean beſides all the expectations or imaginations of men, but onely the unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of any proper means to effect it, this alone according to the common courſe of the actings and workings of the mindes of men otherwiſe, had been enough to do it.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, but what means needs there be for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the incarnation of the Son of God, or, the uniting the two natures, the divine, and the humane, into one perſon, but onely the will of God, acting in the potencie and power of it? And if ſo, this means might eaſily have been apprehended by men; and conſequently, the want of the knowledge of ſuch a means as you ſpeak of, can be no reaſon, why men might not probably have expected or thought of, this great act of the goodneſſe and power of God, the incarnation of his ſon. To this</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is true, the will and power of God, are cauſes ſufficient to bring any effect whatſoever to paſſe; ſo farre as efficiencie (properly ſo called) is able to produce an effect. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though they be ſufficient cauſes in reſpect of any effect whatſoever (with the limitation mentioned) yet they are not probable cauſes of any effect, ſave onely in conjunction and concurrence with ſuch ſecond cauſes, which are proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect with them; or elſe of ſuch effects, as they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:111412:117"/> produce conſtantly, and without ceaſing. As for example: the will and power of God are probable cauſes of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and continuance of the univerſe, though in reſpect of theſe effects, they are in no conjunction with ſecondary cauſes, but perform them by themſelves alone. But why are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or likely cauſes of theſe effects? not becauſe of their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tencie or ſufficiencie to produce them; but becauſe of their long accuſtomed and experienced imploiment in producing them: They have ſupported the creation in being for ſo many generations; therefore it's probable and likely they will doe ſo ſtill. But in reſpect of contingent effects, and which are produced but now and then, though they be as ſufficient cauſes of theſe effects as of thoſe other, yet they are no probable cauſes of them, except they be joined with particular and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſes, and which have a naturall tendencie to produce theſe effects alſo. As for example, the will and power of God, or, the powerfull will of God, is able to make a poor man, who to day <hi>is deſtitute of daily food,</hi> rich, and worth many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, before to morrow: but it is no probable cauſe of ſuch an effect; it is ten thouſand to one, that it will not effect it. The reaſon is, becauſe ſuch an effect as this is contingent, and there is no means or ſecond cauſe in view likely to join with the powerfull will of God therein. Now the incarnation of the Sonne of God, was an effect of this kinde: it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent; yea and moſt rarely contingent; never any like to it, or neer to it, effected or brought forth, from the daies of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Therefore the will of God, though it be granted to be a ſufficient cauſe of it, yet was it no probable or likely cauſe of it; and therefore the knowledge of this cauſe in men, did no waies incline or accommodate them, to expect, or ſo much as to think of it: the eye of the reaſons or underſtandings of men, were no waies like, ever to have faſtened upon this cauſe, as likely to have produced the effect we ſpeak of. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the will and power of God be cauſes ſufficient in reſpect of any effect whatſoever, as farre as efficiencie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, <hi>i.</hi> the vertue of that kinde of cauſe, which we call efficient, can poſſibly contribute towards the effect; yet
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:111412:117"/> they are not ſufficient without the concurrence and mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome other cauſe, or cauſes, in reſpect of ſuch effects, which ſtand in need of other cauſes beſides efficient cauſes, to produce, or give them being. For example, the will and power of God are cauſes abundantly ſufficient to make a man; but they are not ſufficient to make a man without a reaſonable ſoul; becauſe a reaſonable ſoul is an eſſentiall requiſite to the being of a man; and whatſoever God ſhould make without a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul, is not that kinde of creature, which we call, man, whatever elſe it may be. The rule of the Schoolmen is moſt true, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Now then, be it granted, that men might very poſſibly apprehend the will and power of God to be ſufficient cauſes of producing ſuch an effect, as the incarnation of his ſon, as well as of any other poſſible effect whatſoever; yet there being other cauſes, or at leaſt another cauſe, as neceſſary to the actuall production of ſuch an effect as this (I mean, the making of the ſon of God, man, or, the ſon of man) as the will and power of God themſelves; and this cauſe, or cauſes, being no waies ſuch, as were ever like to enter into the heart or thoughts of men, evident it is, that this great effect we ſpeak of, the incarnation of the ſon of God, muſt needs be a myſtery to men, a thing which they were no waies likely to have thought of, or to have expected, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they did, or might, apprehend the will and power of God ſufficient cauſes to produce as great and difficult matters, as this.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, but what cauſe, or cauſes, were there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary or requiſite to the incarnation of the ſon of God beſides the will and power of God, which were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have occurred in the way of the mindes and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:111412:118"/> thoughts of men, in all their traveils and enquiries.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the two natures, the divine and the humane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hypoſtatically or perſonally united in the Son of God being made fleſh, doe neceſſarily require ſome band or tie, or means of ſuch an union: and this band, cauſe, or means of the union we ſpeak of, is that further cauſe we mean, which is required to make the Sonne of God, man, beſides the power of God, and which we affirm to be a thing altogether unlikely to have ever been thought of by men. We ſaid before, that God himſelf could not ſupply the defect, or place of the formall cauſe of any thing, but muſt of neceſſity create or produce a formall cauſe in being, if he means to make the thing it ſelf: ſo in this caſe, intending to unite his own divine nature, and the nature of man in one and the ſame perſon, and to make one Chriſt of both, he muſt of neceſſity create, or make ſome band or other, by which the two natures, being in themſelves not only diſtinct, but infinitely diſproportioned the one unto the other, might become ſo intimately and intirely one, as an hypoſtaticall or perſonall union importeth. This, evidence of reaſon, yea all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſence it ſelf teacheth, that two things of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or beings, cannot come to combine to make a third thing, which ſhall be intirely and perfectly one in it ſelf, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from them both, but that firſt, there muſt be ſome efficient cauſe or other, ſo to unite and combine them together: and ſecondly, there muſt be alſo ſomewhat in the nature of a band common to them both, by which, 1. all two-neſſe (as it were) or plurality of beings between them, muſt be either diſolved, or prevented; and 2. ſuch a relation founded between them, whereby one muſt be looked upon as a part of the other, I mean, as a fellow part with it, and ſo both of them as together intirely conſtituting one and the ſame thing, or being. The bringing or putting of two things together ſimply, though it be with never ſo much neerneſſe of the one unto the other, doth not preſently make them one and the ſame thing, or one and the ſame being, doth not make one to be a part of the other; but there muſt be ſomewhat of another nature raiſed between them, which muſt give them another manner of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intireneſſe and relation, then any locall ſcituation or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:111412:118"/> neerneſſe of place can doe. The body and ſoul in a living man, are truly and properly one, <hi>i</hi> make one and the ſame perſon and being: but a ſpirit, good or bad, Angel, or devil, joining it ſelf with, or putting it ſelf into, whether a living, or dead body of a man, and acting out of it, or by it, as the ſoul it ſelf doth, as by ſpeaking, walking, or the like, doth not make one and the ſame perſon with that humane body, or perſon, which it thus acteth, or poſſeſſeth. The ſpirit in this caſe, is no fellow-part with that body, where to it is joined, but remains a diſtinct being by it ſelf, notwithſtanding any ſuch union as this. The reaſon of the difference is; becauſe there is a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall band, between the body and the ſoul in a living man; which there is not between a ſpirit, and the body or perſon of a man, notwithſtanding the one be poſſeſſed and acted by the other: In like manner, that the Son of God ſhould be incarnate or <hi>made fleſh</hi> (in the Scripture ſence) <hi>i</hi> ſhould perſonally be united to the nature of man, ſo that one and the ſame perſon, who is called Chriſt, ſhould be the reſult, as it were, and product of both thus united; it was abſolutely neceſſary, not onely that he ſhould act, be eſſentially, preſent with, or in, and ſo ſhew his divine power, out of, this nature, but further, that a perſonall band ſhould intercede between him (I mean between his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature) and this humane nature aſſumed, which ſhould take hold of both; and raiſe another manner of relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them for intireneſſe and oneneſſe of being, then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him (or his divine nature) and all the holy men that ever were in the world; in many of whom notwithſtanding he acted, and ſhewed forth his divine power, by ſundry acts of the ſame nature with thoſe, which he acted in that very part of the humane nature, which he had perſonally aſſumed unto himſelf. Now then this is that which I ſay; that ſame perſonall band (as I call it) by the mediation whereof thoſe two natures, ſo infinitely diſtanced and differing the one from the other, the divine and the humane, became one perſon, and without which, it were, and had been ſimply unpoſſible that ever they ſhould have met, or combin'd in ſuch a way (I mean, to make one and the ſame perſon) is even now, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But that humility, or condeſcention to the creature, which God ſheweth in ſuch aſpects of his Providence, and in ſuch a tenour of diſpenſations as theſe, belong unto him, as he is the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world; and much in ſuch a ſence, <hi>vengeance</hi> is ſaid to <hi>belong unto him.</hi> But that grace and condeſcention in God, and in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, in his incarnation, in vouchſafing

Now to make ſome kinde of eſtimate of the ſtrangeneſſe and wonderfullneſſe of this condeſcention, it will be neceſſary to take into conſideration, to weigh and ponder theſe circumſtances; 1. The ſublimity, the tranſcendent excellencie of the divine nature. 2. The depth, I mean, the weakneſſe and vileneſſe of the humane nature. 3. The ſmall incouragement he had by way of ingagement from that nature, to yield to ſuch a condeſcention, as to be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to it. 4. The ſmall incouragement he had from any hope of gain or benefit likely to accrue to himſelf, by ſuch a condeſcention as this. 5. (Laſtly) the great abuſements which he knew he was further to undergoe and to abide in this nature aſſumed, over and beſides the aſſumption it ſelf of it. For the firſt, the ſupertranſcendent excellencie and ſublimity of the divine nature, is ſuch, that it is an object, proportioned only unto, and comprehenſible only by, it ſelf. And as the beating back of the eye by the ſun with a kinde of indignation and diſdain to be (directly) beheld or looked upon by it, argueth a marveilous ſtrength and fulneſſe of light in it; ſo doth that conſtant ſending-empty-away of the reaſons and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men by God, when they come to faſten, and feed upon the contemplation of his eſſence and being, abundantly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and prove, a ſtrength, fulneſſe, glory, and perfection of being in him, which diſdaineth all proportion, or commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſſe, with any creature whatſoever, yea with all of them put together. 2. For the weakneſſe and vileneſſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, eſpecially ſince infeſted and embaſed by ſinne, <hi>quot homines, tot teſtes;</hi> there are as many witneſſes, what, and how great it is, as there are men. And though the Son of God did not aſſume it with any defilement or embaſement of ſinne; yet (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>God ſent his Son in the ſimilitude</hi>

               <hi>or likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh; i.</hi> in ſuch fleſh, in that fleſh, which to the eye, and in outward appearance, differed nothing from that, which was ſinfull indeed (no, the ſinfulneſſe of it it ſelf, not excepted) yea which was charged with all thoſe naturall weakneſſes and infirmities, which that fleſh, which is really ſinnefull, is univerſally expoſed, and ſubject unto. 3. He was ſo farre from being under any ingagement whatſoever, to that nature, which with ſuch an infinite condeſcention, he did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume (I mean, unto men) that as farre as evil intreaties, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, provocations in the higheſt, could interpoſe and prevail with him, he was likely to have ſtood ingaged and bent in his reſolutions and deſires, upon the ruine and deſtruction of it. 4. Nor could he expect, being truly and ſubſtantially God, that any matter of gain, advantage, or addition of good in what kinde ſoever, ſhould, or could accrue unto him, by ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention; that which is infinite, can have nothing, either added to it, or taken from it. 5. (And laſtly) nor could he but know, even before he put on, and ware that garment, or cloathing of fleſh, which we ſpeak of, how it would be rent and torn, and a thouſand waies abuſed, before he ſhould come to put it off again. Theſe circumſtances (with ſome others of like conſideration, which might be added to them) duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, muſt needs render the condeſcention of the Sonne of God, in his incarnation, hyperbolically ſtrange, wonderfull, and myſterious.</p>
            <p>Thus have we at laſt fully and cleerly demonſtrated unto you (though in ſome what a more generall way, and in the main car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of it only) that tranſcendent excellency of divine wiſdom, which ſhines in the Goſpel; &amp; which we laid down in the eighth place, amongſt our arguments or conſiderations of the ſecond ſort, to prove the Scriptures, and ſo the Goſpel, to be from God. As for all the particularities of this wiſdom we ſpeak of, they are like <hi>the starres in the firmament of heaven</hi> for their multitude, which no man can number, or call by their names, but only he that made them. Let us now (in a word) weigh and conſider attentively, what there is in the conſideration argued, to demonſtrate, or prove the Goſpel to be from God. <hi>With him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of God) <hi>is wiſedom and ſtrength: he hath</hi>

If men be born blinde, their blindneſſe, or non-ſeeing of things, cannot be aſcribed to any accident that ſhall befall them afterwards. But this only by the way: and that in reference to ſomewhat lately delivered, and for the ſtrengthening and confirmation thereof: otherwiſe there are many other things, obſervable in the verſe. But (as to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in hand) you cleerly ſee, that either the holy Ghoſt himſelf, or whoſoever it was, that framed the Epiſtle, wherein the paſſage late mentioned ſtands, judgeth that excellent <hi>light</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:111412:122"/> of wiſdom, which <hi>ſhines</hi> from the face of the Goſpel, to be an evident and undeniable character of the royall parentage and deſcent of it from God. Let all the books, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate writings of men, be drawn together, thoſe that are of greateſt obſervation and name, let them bring forth and ſhew all their treaſures of wiſdom and underſtanding; the Goſpel will, or at leaſt well may, be as cleerly diſtinguiſhed and known from all the reſt, by thoſe heights and depths of wiſdom that are here, as the heavens are from the earth by their height, and the ſea being fadomed where it is deepeſt, from the flatts and ſhallows of ſmaller rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea the ſun is not more eaſily diſcerned from the ſtarres of the night by that ſuperabundant exceſſe of light which he carries about him, then the Goſpel may be from all humane writings whatſoever, by that predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancie of wiſdom and underſtanding, which is ſeen in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all. <hi>The gleanings of the grapes</hi> of the wiſdom of the Goſpel, are better then the <hi>whole vinta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All the ſubtile ſtratagems, and wiſe projections, and profound policies of men, that are read or heard of from any other hand whatſoever, are but like devices how to catch flies, or to make bubbles in the aire, ſuch as little children uſe to ſport withall, in compariſon of that unfadomable, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigne, by which God hath projected, not the ſaving only, but the glorifying alſo of a loſt world. This for this eighth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p>The ninth argument ariſing from the matter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to evince their derivation from God, formerly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was the great and wonderfull myſteriouſneſſe of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:111412:122"/> Evangelicall tranſaction, delivered and laid forth in them. Of this myſteriouſneſſe of the Goſpel, and of the many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements whereof it conſiſts, we ſpake ſomewhat largely in the former argument, and therefore ſhall adde little or nothing of it here. When we affirm the great Evangelicall tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which God hath plotted, and brought about the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, to be myſterious, we mean onely this (as was formerly touched) that it was a projection, contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or deviſe, which was as farre from any way, or path ever occupied or walked in, by the reaſons, underſtandings, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of men, as the caſt is from the weſt, or the heavens from the earth, and which was altogether unlikely ever to have come up into the mindes and thoughts of men. Now how, and upon what grounds and conſiderations, and wherein, this myſteriouſneſſe of it appeareth, was argued at large in the foregoing point. Let us only (in a word) weigh the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this myſteriouſneſſe we ſpeak of, and ſee what ſtrength there is in it, to prove the Goſpel it ſelf to come from God. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>fleſh: and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit:</hi> meaning, that each of theſe births, anſwers their originall, in nature, properties, inclinations, diſpoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever proceeds from man, ſuppoſe in a way of reaſoning, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive invention, contrivement, or the like, doth but anſwer the genius, or that line of reaſon, wiſdom and underſtanding which is humane, and that which is, or very poſſibly may be, found in other men. It is true, the ſphere wherein ſome mens apprehenſions and underſtandings move, and work, is much larger, and more comprehenſive, then other mens; ſome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vigour, ſtrength, and activeneſſe of their reaſons and underſtandings, are able to travail further in inquiries after truth, then others, and to make diſcoveries of things, that lie at a farre greater diſtance, then they: ſome mens capacities and wits are only made and ſerve them to travail their native countrey and places neer home, being capable onely of things neer at hand, and which all men generally know, or may know with eaſe: others, are made for long voyages, with abilities and inclinations to coaſt <hi>terra incognita;</hi> unknown countries,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:111412:123"/> and to make diſcoveries and reports of things there. But as it was in the Iſraelites gathering of <hi>Manna, he that gathered leaſt, had no want; and he that gathered moſt had no overplus:</hi> ſo in the caſe we ſpeak of; as the workings, contrivements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the meaneſt, and moſt ordinary underſtandings of men, want not altogether the ſavour of that which is common to men (I mean, reaſon) they have ſome taſte, more or leſſe, of what is proper to men: ſo neither have the theories, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, and atchievements of the richeſt and moſt ſublime underſtandings of men, any overplus (I mean, any thing more excellent) then what is humane, and what upon a due ſearch into, and conſideration had of it, may be cleerly known to be but from men. Therefore, when any ſuch piece of wiſdom, or projection of a buſineſſe, ſhall be preſented to us, wherein upon diligent inquiry made, there plainly appears <hi>aliquid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtius,</hi> that which is more adorable, myſterious, and divine, then what is any waies likely, yea or indeed poſſible, to fall within the compaſſe of the largeſt ſphere of the underſtanding of men, as to the contrivement of it; there is a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conclude and build upon, that doubtleſſe a greater wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom then any that is humane, was intereſſed in the framing and compoſure of it. Now that the Goſpel, or that great Goſpel tranſaction (as I called it) is of that conſideration we ſpeak of, a piece of wiſdom, a projection, which carries a fuller and more majeſtique luſtre of wiſdom in the face of it, then ever was known to appear, or is any wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

So that if men were not under the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and juſtly delivered up by God unto him to make fools and ſots of, in reſpect of the great things of their peace, they could not but ſee the very compleat image and likeneſſe of God himſelf in the Goſpel, as being that which is moſt manifeſt, and moſt plainly and palpably diſcernable, from the ſimilitudes or likeneſſes of all creatures whatſoever; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſubject themſelves in faith and obedience to it.

So (ſaith the Apoſtle, in effect) is the image and likeneſſe of God, when it is preſented before men, as it is in the Goſpel (where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is gloriouſly preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) eaſie enough to be diſtinguiſhed and known, from the ſuperſcription or likeneſſe of any other being whatſoever, if men be not either ſmitten with ſpirituall <hi>blindneſſe</hi> by the hand of Satan, or willingly ſhut their eyes againſt it. Where the ſight is but weak and dimme, yet if the object be full of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and very eaſie to be diſcerned, it is able to apprehend it; if a man hath but a glimmering of a ſeeing faculty, he will be able to diſcern an houſe from a man, or from a tree, neer at hand; ſo though mens reaſons and underſtandings be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſlow, and dark, and dimme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſuch an object as God is, ſo full of intelligility, or of that which may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and underſtood, being in a cleer glaſſe propoſed and brought neer to them, certainly may be diſcerned by them, and known from other objects, if the <hi>God of this world</hi> hath not breathed upon them, and blaſted them. Indeed if <hi>Chriſt</hi> were only the <hi>image</hi> of ſome creature, as of a man, or an Angel, and <hi>not of God;</hi> the Apoſtle ſeems to ſuppoſe, that though he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:111412:124"/> were preſented in the Goſpel to the utmoſt line and lineament of his beauty and perfection, yet the <hi>light of the Goſpel might not have ſhined unto them,</hi> though Satan had <hi>not blinded their mindes:</hi> becauſe ſuch an object as this, would have had but <hi>parum de ratione formali,</hi> little of that in it, which makes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject intelligible, and apt to be diſtinguiſhed from other things, by the underſtanding; all created beings being empty of entity or being, and conſequently of intelligibility, comparatively in reſpect of God. But now, Chriſt being <hi>the image of God,</hi> who contains all perfection and fulneſſe of entity and being, and conſequently of whatſoever is intelligible and that may be apprehended and underſtood; and withall, being ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and fully ſet forth, as he is in the Goſpel; if men doe not ſee the light of truth in it, and that it is from God, it is a certain ſigne, either that <hi>that evil one</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> calls him) hath <hi>touched them</hi> in the <hi>eyes of their underſtandings,</hi> and made them blinde; or elſe that they wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the light of it, and do not ſee it, meerly becauſe they will not, or care not to doe it. And ſo the ſame Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> asks them, who <hi>had bewitched them, i.</hi> hindered and bound, as it were, their reaſons, judgements, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <note place="margin">Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If you ask me, why ſo? the Apoſtle himſelf anſwers you in the caſe of the <hi>Galatians</hi> (in the place mentioned) where he gives this reaſon why they muſt needs be <hi>bewitched,</hi> in that they did not <hi>obey the truth</hi> of the Goſpel; <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt had <hi>been plainly deſcribed unto them: before whoſe eyes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth,</hi> [delineated, or deſcribed, as the word ſignifieth] <hi>crucified among you.</hi> Whereby he plainly inſinuates, that the image or portracture of Chriſt, being ſo drawn to the life, as it is in the Goſpel, by the hand of the holy Ghoſt, (eſpecially) if it be but well and cleerly ſhewed, and preſented unto men in the miniſtry thereof: is ſuch an
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:111412:124"/> object, or image, which is ſufficiently convincing of its own verity and conformity, 1. to the perſon of Chriſt; 2. to the nature of God, where the eyes of mens reaſons and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings have not been ſhut up, or at leaſt dazled and made unſerviceable for ſuch a purpoſe, by the devil. If the truth of the Goſpel were ſuch, or ſo conditioned, that men by nature, I mean, before they receive any ſecret and penal ſtroke upon the eyes of their mindes from the devils hand, were no waies capable of it, and of conſenting to it; the Apoſtle would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have asked the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who <hi>had bewitched them,</hi> that <hi>they did not obey it.</hi> But this by the way. As to our buſineſſe in hand; this is that which I deſire you will take ſpeciall notice of upon occaſion of the former paſſage of Scripture (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation whereof given, hath been cleered and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this latter) that the great and profound myſteriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that bleſſed tranſaction in the Goſpel, wherein the ſalvation of the world works with ſo high an hand, is one of the faireſt and moſt diſcernable lineaments of the image of God that is to be ſeen there; and conſequently is very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and demonſtrative, to evince the Goſpel to be from God.</p>
            <p>The tenth (and laſt) argument from the matter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that was propoſed to ſatisfie the ſoul and conſcience about their originall, and to prove that they are from God, was this: the glorious, and moſt tranſcendent importance of this tranſaction of the Goſpel, by way of benefit and bleſſing upon the world. Amongſt many others, there are theſe eight great benefits and bleſſings, which the Goſpel is ſet, and ſeeks to bring upon the world; yea and which it actually brings upon the heads of all thoſe, who unfainedly deſire, and ſeek after them. The firſt, is our reconciliation with God, or unto God. Secondly, our juſtification, or righteous-making in the ſight of God. Thirdly, our adoption, or ſonſhip unto God. Fourthly, the mortification of the body of ſin and death in men. Fiftly, the quickning unto, or the inſpiration of, a new life, to live holily, and unto God. Sixtly, peace of conſcience, with God, or towards God. Seventhly, our redemption or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the wrath and vengeance which is to come. Eightly,

As one of thoſe that were in the high Prieſts Hall, with <hi>Peter,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him by his ſpeech or language, to be none belonging to the high Prieſt or his family, nor of thoſe that came againſt his Maſter, but to belong unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and challenged him upon it; <hi>ſurely alſo thou art one of them; for thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee:</hi> in <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 73.</note> like manner, the very nature and ſubject of the diſcourſe of the Scriptures; eſpecially upon, and about the ſubjects menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, cleerly diſcover them, to be none of the writings of the wiſdom or learning of this world; becauſe there is not a <hi>lip</hi> of ſuch <hi>excellencie,</hi> not a pen that ever advanced ſuch a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſublime diſcourſe, that ever ſo much as faced the world, no not with the leaſt mention or overture of things ſo ſuper-tranſcendently rich and glorious, to be found amongſt all the ſcribes, or wiſe-men, of this ſchool and order. And as the Lord Chriſt gave this account to the diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> who were ſent unto him, to inquire whether he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or no, to prove himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> indeed: <hi>The blinde receive their ſight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:111412:126"/> great argument that he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> indeed, the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour of the world; in like manner, when we hear of the enemies of God reconciled to him, of ſinners juſtified, of aliens and ſtrangers adopted for ſons and daughters unto God; of ſinne and corruption mortified, where ſometime they were alive; of men quickned, and made alive unto righteouſneſſe, who before were <hi>dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes;</hi> of men redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who were the worſt and moſt miſerable of bond men and vaſſalls; of men glorified, and made like unto the Angels, who were the children of ſhame, vileneſſe, and contempt; I ſay when we hear of all theſe great and marveilous things, partly already brought to paſſe, partly undertaken, and this, with all poſſibly-imaginable likelihood to be brought to paſſe, in the times and ſeaſons aſſigned hereunto, by a piece of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or learning; may we not without any fear or doubting conclude, that certainly this wiſdom, this learning, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the bleſſedneſſe of the world to this height, is not from men, but from God? For what greater things then theſe can God himſelf, if he ſhould ingage himſelf with all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom it ſelf, though it be infinite, what greater things then theſe can he project, or by his power bring to paſſe for the ſonnes and daughters of men? This for our tenth and laſt demonſtration, taken from the ſubſtance, or ſubject matter of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We have now finiſhed our firſt kinde of arguments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, to evince the divine origi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all of the Scriptures, which were ſuch, as we called intrinſecall, and are found in the Goſpel it ſelf; which we ſubdivided again, or differenced under two heads; ſome of them were taken from the manner; the other, from the matter of the Scriptures. We now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond generall head, or kinde of argument, to demonſtrate the ſame truth (I mean that the Scriptures are from God) theſe we formerly called extrinſecall, becauſe they are the conſiderations of ſuch things, which doe not inhere in the Scriptures, nor properly reſult from them; but yet they face them, and relate to them with ſuch a kinde of relation, which takes hold of the divinity of them, as the former did, and demonſtrates the ſame parentage, and deſcent of them,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:111412:127"/> with thoſe other. The particulars of this kinde of argument, or conſideration alſo, which we call extrinſecall, may be ranged under two ſubordinate heads likewiſe. The former are ſuch paſſages or acts of providence, whereby God plainly owns the Scriptures as his, and from him: the latter, are ſuch, either doings, or ſayings of men, which are ſo farre confederate, with thoſe providences of God, as to join in teſtimony with them on the behalf of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>For the former of theſe; thoſe great actings, and workings of providence, which relate unto the Scriptures, by way of teſtimony, that they are from God, are chiefly five. 1. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull preſervation of the Scriptures: 2. the manner of the plantation of the Goſpel when it firſt went forth into the world, with the ſtrange ſucceſſe which attended it: 3. the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and punctuall fulfilling of the predictions contained in the Scriptures, in their ſeaſon: 4. The great and wonderfull effects, which God hath formerly, and continues ſtill daily to produce and work by the Goſpel, and miniſtry of it: 5. (And laſtly) the government of the world, carried on and managed with ſuch a ſweet conformity to the Scriptures, and according to the tenour of the Goſpel, and the high things thereof. To which you may adde (if you pleaſe) the remarkable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that have been executed and inflicted upon their chief enemies.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe; that great hand of providence which hath appeared in preſerving of the body, or books of the Scriptures, for ſo many generations together, as have paſſed over them, ſince the firſt writing of them, in the midſt of ſo many dangers, and againſt ſo many indeavours to root them out of the world, is a great argument that they belong unto God, as the authour and parent of them. It is a common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in naturall Philoſophy. <hi>Eadem eſt cauſe procreans &amp; conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans.</hi> The procreating, and preſerving, cauſe of things, is one and the ſame. And as the Scripture ſeems to make that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God towards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his not <hi>ſuffering him to ſee corruption,</hi> though he were in the grave, and ſo (as it were) in the very hand and power of corruption; an argument that he was his ſon, his <hi>holy one; thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to</hi>

               <hi>ſee corruption;</hi> ſo is that hand of protection and preſervation, which God for ſo many years (or rather ages) together hath conſtantly held over the Scriptures, not ſuffering them <hi>to ſee corruption</hi> in one kinde or other, when as the world, and the enemies thereof, who ſought their corruption and deſtruction, ſeem to have had them under their power, and that they might have done to them, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid they did unto <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>even what they liſt;</hi> that God (I ſay) hath all this while preſerved the Scriptures in the midſt of ſo many dangers, and likelyhoods of miſcarrying, is a very ſtrong preſumption (at leaſt) that they have ſome peculiar intereſt in him, and are <hi>holy</hi> unto him with a more endeared <hi>holineſſe,</hi> then other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>There are three kindes of corruption, or periſhings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto books and writings are obnoxious; and ſo the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves alſo, ſo farre as they partake in the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of other writings. The one is, by an utter loſſe or periſhing of all, and every part and parcell of the writing; when there is not ſo much as a fragment, fragments, or broken piece remaining. The ſecond is, when they are much diſmembred and maimed, ſo that the beauty and comelineſſe of their ſtructure and frame is wholly defaced, and ſome, or more, of the more conſiderable and principall things at firſt contained in them, wholly loſt, or periſhed from the world. The third and laſt kinde of periſhing is, when their body or bulk is not diminiſhed, nay perhaps this may be augmented; but the ſpirit and life of that knowledge, or of thoſe truths, which were at firſt plainly and cleerly held forth in them, is much infeebled, if not quite diſſolved and deſtroyed, by falſifications, additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſubſtractions, and alterations in one kinde or other. Now from all theſe kindes of corruptions or periſhings, God hath, if not by way of perfect miracle, yet by a very high and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hand of providence, preſerved the Scriptures: and ſhall we not then think that they are his?</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a matter of marveilous conſideration, if we look downwards, and towards the earth only (I mean, only upon ſecond cauſes) that the whole body of the Scriptures, ruſh and branch, they and their memoriall with them, are not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:111412:128"/> this periſhed from under the heavens: conſidering, 1. what numbers of enemies they have alwaies had, who have ſought their extirpation and ruine: 2. with how perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable an hatred, theſe (at leaſt many of them) have ſought their ſuppreſſion: 3. how potent many of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been, furniſhed with power in abundance (in the eye of reaſon) to wreck their hatred upon them in this kinde: 4. what opportunities they have had, and advantages, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their power: 5. (and laſtly) what hath been attempted by ſome of them in this kind. Theſe circumſtances taken into conſideration, render the providence of God little leſſe then miraculous, in the preſervation of them to this day; eſpecially without any maim, or loſſe of limb (as it were) yea or corruption or falſification in any part of them (as we ſhall adde in the other particulars) but let us (for diſpatch ſake) run over the particulars mentioned very briefly; which otherwiſe might be much enlarged from hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay the Scriptures, and the doctrine conteined in them, have very many enemies; as 1. all the devils in hell: and 2. all wicked, ungodly, and prophane perſons on the earth. Firſt, all the devils in hell, yea and out of hell (if they be not in hell, whilſt they are in the aire, and compaſſing the earth to and fro) but the whole hoſt of this accurſed kinde of creature, which we know is numerous above meaſure, are certainly enemies to the Scriptures, and ſeek their ruine. The enmity and hatred which the devil bears to the Scriptures, is diſcovered ſeverall waies. 1. in that he watcheth the ſeed of the doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when it is ſown by the hand of the ſpirituall ſeedsman in the hearts of men, and catcheth at it immediately, and many times <hi>ſnatcheth it away,</hi> as ſoon as ever it is fallen upon the ſoul; which ſhews, that he is not willing it ſhould remain there, no not for the ſhorteſt ſeaſon. And if he be not willing it ſhould remain in the heart of a man, ſurely he would not have it have any place of being in the world. But that diſpoſition and practiſe of his we ſpeak of, you ſhall finde cleerly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour himſelf, in his explication of the parable of <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The devils emnity againſt the Scriptures, and the doctrine
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:111412:128"/> thereof, appears in this; that they are ſtill caſting blocks in one kinde or other, in the way of thoſe, that are moſt able and willing to propagate the knowledge of them in the world; to prevent them of their opportunities, and hinder them from the work. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> complains, that when he was reſolved, and <hi>endeavoured abundantly</hi> to have gon to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> to ſtrengthen and edifie the Saints there, <hi>Satan hindered</hi>

            <p n="3">3. In that he attempts the diſcouragement, and moleſtation, both temporall and ſpirituall, of thoſe that are the profeſſours and upholders of them in the world. Thus <hi>Antipas,</hi> a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Martyr, is ſaid to have been ſlain, where <hi>Satans</hi> ſeat or <hi>throne</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 13.</note> was, and where he dwelt; to imply, that <hi>Satan</hi> was the chief ſtickler to procure his death. And our Saviour ſignified in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> would caſt ſome <note place="margin">verſ 10.</note> of them into priſon, and that they ſhould have perſecution ten daies, <hi>viz.</hi> by his means, and inſtigation of men to perſecute them. Again, that he is ſtill attempting the ſpirituall diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and diſcouragement, of ſuch as hold forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the doctrine of them, unto the world, appears from many places. <hi>Reſist the devil and he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The devils hatred againſt the Scriptures, and the doctrine thereof, appears in this; that he endeavours all he can to <hi>blinde the mindes of men,</hi> that <hi>the light</hi> of them ſhould not <hi>ſhine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> unto them. As farre as lies in his power, he labours to keep the world <hi>in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> the light of the Goſpel, is to the devil, as <hi>the light of the morning</hi> to the <hi>thief and murtherer</hi> in <hi>Job, i.</hi> as <hi>the ſhadow of death.</hi> When it <note place="margin">Job. 24. 17.</note> ſhines in the eyes of mens mindes, it is as <hi>a ſword that paſſeth through his ſoul;</hi> yea when men are <hi>lifted up into heaven</hi> by it, the devil is <hi>thrown down</hi> from his heaven, into his hell. When the ſeventy Diſciples, having been ſent forth by our Saviour, to work miracles, and preach the Goſpel, returned back to him,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:111412:129"/> relating with joy what great ſucceſſe they had had in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, againſt the devils; our Saviour made them this anſwer; <hi>I beheld Satan, as lightning, falling from heaven; q. d.</hi> I <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 18.</note> was a ſpectatour of the combate between Satan and you, whilſt you were in the ingagement, about which I ſent you, and knew before you came to relate to me your ſucceſſe, how that great enemie of yours, and of men, the devil, fell before you: <hi>I ſaw him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like lightning falling from heaven,</hi>

               </gap> out of the heaven, wherein he was before your coming againſt him; <hi>i.</hi> I ſaw him with extream regret and torment quitting the poſſeſſion, which he had before, both of the ſouls, and bodies of men; which poſſeſſions were as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond heaven unto him: but (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) I ſaw him falling</hi> from this <hi>heaven</hi> after the ſame manner, or upon the ſame terms that <hi>lightning</hi> ſometimes falls, or rather is forced, from the materiall heavens, or the clouds of heaven (as the Scripture uſually calls them) <hi>i,</hi> by a motion very contrary to his nature and diſpoſition; as the deſcent or falling of lightning, from the heavens, to the earth, is contrary to the nature and proper inclination of it, which being of a fiery and light nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires naturally to aſcend, and to be above, in the circumference, not to deſcend and fall downwards towards the center. But this by the way, to ſhew the main ground and reaſon, of the devils enmity and hatred againſt the Goſpel; <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an engine in the hand of God to batter him down from his heaven upon earth, to diſpoſſeſſe him of that intereſt and hold, he hath in the hearts, and judgements, and lives of men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) his enmity againſt the Scriptures and main doctrine thereof, the Goſpel, appears in this, that he tempts, perſwades, and ingageth men from time to time, to invent and ſubſtitute other Goſpels, and other doctrines, and other Chriſts, as neer, and with as much affinity and ſimilitude, to the true Goſpel, and true doctrines, and the true Chriſt, as he knows how: and ſo to hold them forth unto the world, on purpoſe to trouble and confound the mindes and thoughts of men, and to put the world into a maze, to make men at a loſſe, which, or what to call the Goſpel, or what the truth, or who the true

               <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea and to make them queſtion whether there be any Goſpel, any doctrine, any Chriſt at all, able, or likely to bleſſe them. Such wiles, and methods, and ſtratagems as theſe put upon the world, are (I conceive) called the doctrines and <hi>depths</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> by our Saviour himſelf, in his epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Thyatira.</hi> I ſhall not need to inſtance in particulars <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 24.</note> in this kinde; it is two well known, and two commonly found (and it hath been the devils ſieve of vanity, to ſift all ages and nations withall, where ſo much as the ſound or mention of the Goſpel hath come) that there are falſe Goſpels, and falſe doctrines, and falſe <hi>Chriſts,</hi> ever and anon putting forth into the world; yet as neer, and as like the true Goſpel, and true doctrines, and the true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the devil can teach his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and workmen to ſhape them; onely providing, that yet there may be ſo much diſſimilitude or unlikeneſſe between them, as may be ſufficient to deceive with danger, and if it be poſſible, to deſtroy with death. Now as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers, are ſaid to have <hi>withſtood Moſes,</hi> becauſe by working falſe miracles, yet in appearance and ſhew the ſame with thoſe true and reall miracles, which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, they oppoſed and obſtructed that convinction in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> his being ſent from God, which otherwiſe could not lightly but have been effected, by the miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, and ſo the deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (which was <hi>Moſes</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne) have been obtained: in like manner they who preach falſe doctrines, and <hi>another Jeſus,</hi> beſides him, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, yet with ſuch a ſemblance of thoſe that are true, that they are ſufficient to entangle and confound the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, are as dangerous oppoſers, and <hi>withſtanders</hi> of the able and faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, as any other ſect of men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee (in the firſt place) that <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> with all his hoſt of <hi>principalities and powers, and ſpirituall wickedneſſes,</hi> are profeſt, yea and ingaged enemies againſt the Scriptures: ye have in part alſo heard the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I adde further, that all wicked and prophane men in the world, are enemies to them alſo. <hi>He that doth evil</hi> (ſaith our <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 20.</note>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:111412:130"/> Saviour) [<hi>i.</hi> whoſoever doth evil] <hi>hates the light; neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> And thoſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> (as they are called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.) <hi>i.</hi> thoſe that held <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 10.</note> forth the light of the truth of the Scriptures unto the world in the times of that great Antichriſtian darkneſſe, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread (in a manner) the whole face of it, are in reſpect of that ingagement of theirs, ſaid to have vexed, <hi>or tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</hi> So that the light of the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Goſpel, is a vexation and <hi>torment</hi> to all earthly minded men; and who is there but hates their tormentours? Wicked and ungodly men, may for ſome by reſpects, and out of ſome carnall ends, come to hear the Scriptures preached; and poſſibly now and then, by the overruling hand of Gods Providence, may ſpeak a good word, or doe a good piece of ſervice for them. But as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>even in laughter</hi>

            <p n="2">2. But though the Scriptures have alwaies had many enemies, yet if they have been any thing qualified in their enmity or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt them, ſo that they have rather deſpiſed them, then oppoſed them, or ſought their deſtruction (as the ſtory ſaith that <hi>Herod</hi> did by two of the brethren of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they were brought before him, becauſe they were poor) the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:111412:130"/> preſervation of them from ruine by God, were ſo much the leſſe conſiderable; nor would it be an argument of that ſtrength and power, to evince that relation of them unto him, which we labour to aſſert and prove, which it is, and upon due conſideration will be found to be, in caſe it appear, that theſe enemies of theirs, are, and ſtill have been (at leaſt the greateſt part of them) full of wrath, deeply and inveterately ſet in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the devils, there is little queſtion but that they bear a <hi>tyrannous hate</hi> againſt them, <hi>hate them with a perfect hatred,</hi> as being their greateſt enemies. If they that <hi>dwell upon earth be tormented</hi> by them, doubtleſſe they that dwell in hell ſeven times more; and proportionable to the torment or damage they receive, or fear to receive from them, ſuch muſt their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to them needs be conceived to be. Though ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and inconſiderate men and women, may poſſibly rather deſpiſe and neglect the Scriptures, and the doctrine thereof, then poſitively hate them, or trouble themſelves with making any oppoſition to them; yet doubtleſſe the <hi>devils</hi> know them better then ſo; I mean, they know them to be of another manner of concernment to them, and their kingdom, of a more formidable importance, then to paſſe them over with contempt, or neglect, <hi>But I hate him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ahab,</hi> one of the ſons of the <hi>devil,</hi> concerning <hi>Michajah) for he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie good concerning me, but evil;</hi> In like manner, the <hi>devils</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That many (at leaſt) and generally, thoſe that are moſt conſiderable, among that other ſort of enemies, which the Scriptures have, and alwaies have had (I mean, evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men) are enemies to purpoſe, traveiling (as it were) in pain with the ſuppreſſion and extirpation of them (at leaſt, of that, which is the life and ſoul of them, the truth of the Goſpel) is every whit as evident as the former. <hi>The Kings of the earth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) ſet themſelves, and the rulers take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell together againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed, ſaying;

Thus then you ſee (in the firſt place) that the enemies of the Scriptures, whether <hi>devils</hi> or men, have allwaies had a great and formidable arme of fleſh, ſtrength and power of hand in abundance; ſo that the difference in this kinde, between them, and the Scriptures, hath been like that which was (at leaſt, was apprehended) between the old inhabitants of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Iſraelites; the one were as <hi>gyants,</hi> the other as <hi>graſhoppers,</hi> in compariſon of them.

            <p n="2">2. The enemies of the Scriptures, as they have been armed with ſtrength of hand to work their ruine in that kinde; ſo have they been furniſhed with another ſtrength too, every whit as proper, as advantagious, and as likely to proſper in an attempt againſt a doctrine, an opinion, a Religion, as that other kinde of ſtrength is; I mean, with wit, ſubtilty, parts, guifts, endowments, as of eloquence, knowledge of arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was ſaid of one of the <hi>Grecian</hi> oratours (<hi>Carneades</hi> by name, as I remember) that <hi>he never pleaded any cauſe but that he carried it.</hi> My brethren, parts of wit, eloquence and knowledge, as they may be raiſed, and as they are found in ſome, what is it (almoſt) in that kinde we ſpeak of, but they are able to doe? The Heathen Oratour ſpake (doubtleſſe) out of experience in part, as well as out of judgement, when he ſaid, that there was <hi>nihil tam dictu incredibile, quod dicando non fiat probabile; i.</hi> that there was nothing ſo incredible in the bare ſpeaking of it, but that may be made very probable by pleading and anguing for it. And it is (in many caſes at leaſt)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:111412:133"/> as true on the other hand; that there is nothing ſo credible, or like unto truth, in the bare affirming or propoſall, but may be ſo disfigured by reaſonings and arguments brought againſt it, that it may be made to look like a palpable errour. Eſpecially this incruſtation or palliation of truths and errours by ſtrength of parts, as of wit, eloquence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is moſt likely to doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution upon, and to beguile perſons of lower parts, and weak underſtandings; and moſt of all, if they be ſingle, and plain-hearted withall. Now then this is that which I ſay; that men of the greateſt abilities, and naturall parts and endowments, for wit, learning, eloquence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been oppoſers of the Goſpel (which indeed is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the Scriptures) and have laboured with all their ſtrength and might to overthrow the goings of it in the world; and on the other hand, thoſe that have beleeved it, and ſtood up to plead the cauſe of it, have (for the moſt part) been perſons of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour guifts and parts, and ſuch as were little raiſed or holpen by education; and withall perſons of plain, open, and ſingle ſpirits. The Scriptures themſelves give teſtimony of both theſe; and the teſtimony of other writers doe in this fully accord with them. <hi>For ye ſee your calling brethren, how that not many</hi>

            <p>For the teſtimony of other authors; it is well known to thoſe that are acquainted with the Church ſtory, and the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Juſtine Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> and others, that <hi>Porphyrie</hi> a great Philoſopher, an acute and ſubtile man, with <hi>Lucian, Libainus,</hi> and many others not much inferiour to them, were profeſſed enemies to the Scriptures, and to the whole doctrine of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; and ſought with all their heart, and with all their ſoul, with all their might, and with all their ſtrength, to lay waſt the honour, intereſt, and authority of the Scriptures, and to make the doctrine of Chriſtian Religion an abhorring unto the world; a loathing to the ſouls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men. And yet we ſee that God hath carried theſe Scriptures and the Religion we ſpeak of through this fire and

Are not theſe then the Scriptures of God? And as a father pleaded the cauſe of this relation of his, to one that doubted it, by this argument, <hi>Et patrio pater eſſe metu probor,</hi> I am ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be thy father, by that fatherly care or fear I have of thee: In like manner, Gods fatherly care to preſerve the Scriptures in the midſt of all dangers and enemies, is a demonſtration of his fatherly relation to them. Eſpecially, if we ſhall conſider how many books and writings beſides, which have been the darlings of the world, and which have had no enemies, no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers (at leaſt none conſiderable) are yet periſhed out of the world, ſcarce ſo much remaining of many of them, as there did of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> when there was nothing of her to be found, but only <hi>her skull and feet, and the palmes of her hands (2 King</hi> 9 35.) and that within a leſſe compaſſe of time, then the Scriptures have continued, at leaſt ſince the firſt edition of them by <hi>Moſes</hi> into the world?

But if it can appear, that theſe enemies of theirs have had that opportunity we ſpeak of from time to time, ſo that in all outward appearance, they have been as much in their hand and power, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was in the power of his enemies when they <hi>did to him, even what they liſted;</hi> or as the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was in the hand of his, when they put him to death; their preſervation upon ſuch terms as theſe, cannot reaſonably be looked upon, but as a conſideration teaching with authority their deſcent from God, and relation to him, as a father.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:111412:134"/>
            <p>Firſt then, it is to be conſidered (in the generall) that look at what advantage the enemies of the Scriptures we ſpeak of, have at any time had the Church and people of God, who have been at all times the onely keepers of this treaſure, at the ſame advantage they have had the treaſure it ſelf (I mean, the Scriptures) ſo that what opportunity they have had at any time to deſtroy and root out the one from the earth, the like they had to deſtroy the other alſo. The Church of God is<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> ſaid to be, <hi>the pillar and ground,</hi> or ſettlement (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>of truth,</hi> or of the truth; meaning, of the Scriptures, or word of God, which by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, is affirmed to be <hi>the truth: Sanctifie them with thy truth, thy word is the truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 17.</note> Now the Church of God is ſaid, 1. to be <hi>the pillar of truth,</hi> becauſe they are that body and ſociety of men in the world, which hold forth that writing or book (I mean, the Scriptures) wherein the great truth of heaven, and of God, is contained. The expreſſion (doubtleſſe) is borrowed, from the manner and cuſtome of thoſe times; which it ſeems by the records of hiſtory more ancient then they, was received by them, and continued, from the firſt times and ages of the world, before books made of paper, parchment, or any ſuch kinde of materiall, were invented or known. In theſe times (ſay ſome) it was the manner of thoſe that were learned, and had knowledge of things any waies ſecret, and yet worthy to be known, to ingrave them in great pillars, or monuments built for that purpoſe, either of brick or ſtone, that ſo they might be for the uſe of the preſent, and likewiſe preſerved for the benefit of poſterity in future generations. But whether this cuſtom of writing in or upon pillars, were either ſo ancient, as is pretended, or ever in uſe at all; certain it is (and there is frequent and cleer mention of it in authours of beſt credit) that it was an uſuall cuſtome in <hi>Rome,</hi> about the times of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> for thoſe that were deſirous to publiſh any thing by way of writing unto the world, to faſten or ſet up their books upon pillars in publike places, for people to read; much after the ſame manner, as we ſee bills, and writings, and titles of books, paſted upon pillars in the Exchange. Now look what office or ſervice thoſe pillars did, to thoſe authours, who
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:111412:135"/> ſet up their books or writings upon them, or to the books themſelves; which was to hold forth the contents of ſuch writings unto publike and open view; the ſame doth the Church of God, unto God himſelf, and to his book, or writing, which he hath put therein (the Scriptures) it holds forth the Doctrine, and all the truth, and truths contained in this book, unto the world. Again, 2. This Church of God is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>ground,</hi> firmament, or firm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſettlement, or ſeat of the <hi>truth;</hi> becauſe God hath not only appointed it, to hold forth the Scriptures unto the world, after the manner of a <hi>Pillar,</hi> which in time may decay, and become ruinous; and then whatſoever depends upon it for publike repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is from thenceforth diſappointed in that kinde; but hath made it a <hi>pillar,</hi> in the nature of a foundation; which uſually is the ſtrongeſt part of the building, and remains, when all the building beſides is ruined: he hath made it as a firm and grounded ſeat for the Scriptures, or the truth (as it were) to ſit and reſt upon for ever. So that now there being, by the will and appointment of God (as you ſee) ſuch an abſolute dependance between the Scriptures and the Church of God in the world, that theſe cannot be held forth unto the world, but by it; nor yet have any place of abode, or being in the world, but in it; evident it is, that look at what advantage the enemies of the Church, or of the Scriptures, have had the Church it ſelf at any time, what opportunities they have had at any time, to make havock, and utter deſolation of this; the ſame advantages, the ſame opportunity they have had to make the Scriptures a deſolation alſo. Now it is (I preſume) a thing generally known unto us all (and ſo we ſhall not need to ſpend time in proof of it) that that company, or fellowſhip of perſons in the world, which are the Church of God, have been from time to time (yea perpetually almoſt and without any <hi>lucidum intervallum,</hi> without any <hi>interim</hi> at all of any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſture or condition) obnoxious, in outward appearance, to the wrath, rage and power of her enemies; and no waies able to have made reſiſtance, or to have defended her ſelf, in caſe they had come forth againſt her, and aſſaulted her, with all that ſtrength and power which they might eaſily have levied
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:111412:135"/> and raiſed up in the world againſt her. It is true, the Church of God hath had ſome criticall daies and houres, wherein for one moment, ſhe hath been in greater danger then ordinary, of being ruined and ſwallowed up at once; and immediately after, upon a miraculous deliverance or eſcape from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hath been upon terms of more ſecurity and ſafety then ordinary; but let her caſe and condition even in her greateſt glory of outward ſtrength, be diligently conſidered; and there will ſcarce be found at any time, any more diſtance (in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) then a ſtep, between her ſoul, and death, between her preſent ſtanding, and falling in the world.</p>
            <p>But more particularly (in the ſecond place) Satan, and the reſt of the enemies of the Scriptures have had them at a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage to ſuppreſſe them, and to cauſe them to ceaſe from the world at once, at ſome times, then at others. It ſeems that in the daies of King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> there was but one copie<note place="margin">2 King. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For firſt, if there had been any more copies of this part of the Scripture we ſpeak of, then that, which was caſually found by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt in the temple; it is not like, but a King ſo zealouſly and piouſly given as <hi>Joſiah</hi> was, would by one means or other have furniſhed himſelf with one: eſpecially the injunction of God upon the Kings being ſo expreſſe and ſtrict as is to be ſeen, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19. And ſecondly, the deportment of the King<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 18, 19.</note> upon hearing the book read, being ſo extraordinarily affected, and afflicted in minde about it, as to <hi>rend his cloaths, and weep,</hi> with ſome other expreſſions, cleerly ſhew, that the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the book were ſtrange, and before this, unknown to him. Thirdly, the carriage of the Prieſt, who is ſaid to have found the book, in ſending it as a choice preſent, by the hand of ſuch a meſſenger as <hi>Shaphan</hi> (a chief officer of ſtate) was, evinceth the ſame thing; <hi>viz.</hi> that it was a rarity indeed, and that there were no more copies or tranſcripts of this writing. Fourthly (and laſtly) by the ſtrangeneſſe of the contents of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:111412:136"/> the book (as they appeared both to the Prieſt himſelf, the Scribe that carried it to the King, and the King that heard it read) it ſeems that there had been no copie of it extant for a long time before, and that the tenour, ſubſtance, and contents of it, were matters altogether unknown, not to the generality of the people onely, but eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Prieſts themſelves, upon whoſe <hi>lips</hi> it lay (in ſpeciall manner) <hi>to preſerve knowledge;</hi> yea and to the king alſo. It is conceived by ſome, that it was purpoſely conveyed out of the way, and intended to have been buried in perpetuall darkneſſe, by ſome idolatrous King or other, ſome Prieſt, one or more, being of the ſame accurſed counſell, and complying with him therein; that ſo it might have been ſuppreſſed for ever. So that during all the time, that the book we ſpake of, was loſt, and laid up in the chambers of darkneſſe, <hi>Satan</hi> (at leaſt) had an opportunity to have avenged himſelf of it, had not his hand been reſtrained and held back by one ſtronger then himſelf. And if that conjecture of ſome which we ſpake of, be true (and there is much probability in it) that the book of the law was hidden by ſome idolatrous King or Prieſt, or both, in ſome uncouth and obſcure hole in the wall of the Temple, with an intention, that it ſhould there have periſhed, and never been found more; the providence of God is ſo much the more remarkable in and about the preſervation of it; as it was in permitting <hi>Satan</hi> to ſmite <hi>Job</hi> with a very<note place="margin">Job. 2. 6</note> noiſome and grievous diſeaſe, yet without ſuffering him to touch his life. For if the mighty hand of God had not overruled thoſe, whoever they were, that hid the book of the law, with an intent wholly to ſuppreſſe, or to deſtroy it, and to have it never more ſeen; they might in reaſon, as well have ſecretly burnt it with fire, or cut it in pieces with a penknife, or the like, and ſo have made ſure that it ſhould never have come to light, nor been ſeen more, as to throw it into a by hole, where, though it were not very probable that it would, yet very poſſible it was, that it might, be found before it was conſumed. When the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſacked, and burnt with fire, and<note place="margin">2 Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 36. 19.</note> the Temple it ſelf burnt likewiſe, defaced, made little other then a ruinous heap, and ſo all the while, during the ſeventy years captivity, there was a large opportunity before the God
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:111412:136"/> of this world, to have bound up the Scriptures in the ſame bundle of common calamity and deſtruction with the City, houſe, and people of God; had not the God of heaven put his <hi>hook in his noſe,</hi> and ſaid unto him, deſtroy them not. Again, in the daies of <hi>Diocletian</hi> the Emperour, who ſet on foot the laſt and moſt grievous of the ten primitive perſecutions (as they are commonly called) about the year of Chriſt, 302. there being this edict ſet forth amongſt many others, for the rooting out of Chriſtianity from the earth; to injoin all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that had Bibles, or books of Chriſtianity, under pain of moſt grievous torments, to deliver them into the hands of thoſe, that were ſent about by the Emperour to gather them, to be burnt with fire; there was an opportunity for Satan and his agents, to have put an end and period to the reign, yea or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the Scriptures in the world: Eſpecially conſidering, 1. that the number of Bibles, copies of them being then farre more chargeable, and harder to be gotten, then now, by reaſon they were then all written (which was very coſtly, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Printing) could not be proportionably ſo many to the number of Chriſtians, as now they are; partly alſo, that many of thoſe Chriſtians, who had Bibles, through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their faith, and for fear of the torments threatned, did deliver them into the hand of the inquiſitours to be burnt (for which they were in after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſence of the fiery rage of the Emperour, and torments threatned, to value the lives of their books above their own. For the doctrine of Chriſtianity (more properly ſo called) and the books of the new Teſtament, what an opportunity had that great enemie of God and good men, with his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:111412:137"/> either to have prevented their riſing up, and coming forth into the world, when the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who were the penmen and publiſhers of them, were ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, both for their number, and quality alſo, or power in the world, and might in reaſon, and according to the courſe of other things, have eaſily been taken out of the way, before they had been delivered of thoſe writings; or elſe, to have prevented (at leaſt) their continuance, and propagating in the world, by laying out, and making ſearch for them, when the copies extant were yet but few. Theſe opportunities, and ſome others (poſſibly) like unto theſe, the enemies of the Scriptures have had for a totall ſuppreſſion, or quenching of the light of them in the world. Severall other opportunities alſo they have had, for the adulterating and corrupting of them, for the mangling and maiming of them; more eſpecially theſe two: The firſt, all the while the Chriſtian world lay under a deluge or inundation of <hi>Arrianiſme;</hi> the latter, when it lay under the like inundation and overſpreading of <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> apoſtacy, and idolatrie; which was lower down towards theſe preſent times, and not many generations paſt. Under both theſe eſtates or conditions of the Chriſtian world, Satan had a marveilous advantage, to have procured a depravation of the Scriptures, at leaſt in thoſe places and paſſages, which riſe up with greateſt evidence and ſtrength againſt thoſe errours, wherewith the whole body (in a manner) of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, was now infected. What might not the faction of <hi>Arrius,</hi> being ſo numerous and potent, having not only the generality of ordinary Chriſtians, but the nobility and great perſons in the Empire, yea the Emperours themſelves for their abettours, have done, to deprave and falſifie all ſuch places, which plainly hold forth the Divinity, or Godhead of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> In like manner, when <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his apoſtatizing party had all the Chriſtian world (in a manner) both Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>wondering after them,</hi> and by this means had the ſole inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in correcting and ſetting forth all the new impreſſions of the Scriptures from time to time, what might not they in all likelihood have done, to have compelled the Scriptures to ſpeak plainly for the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> which now they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:111412:137"/> oppoſe with cleereſt evidence and demonſtration? But we ſee, that God by a mighty providence, and by a ſtrange overruling of their ſpirits, hath not ſuffered the Scriptures to feel ſo much as the weight of the little finger of either of them, in this kinde.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) Suppoſe the Scriptures ſhall have had never ſo many enemies; and theſe never ſo full of wrath and envie againſt them; yea, and armed withall manner of power to have wrought their ruine; yea further, that they had had opportunities from time to time to have effected their ruine; yet if they had been negligent and ſlept away their opportunities, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at any time to effect it, the preſervation and protection of them had not been altogether of that wonderfull conſideration, which now it is; conſidering, that ſome of theſe opportunities have been improved by a very high hand, and with much diligence and vigour, to ſuch an end. And for thoſe, which ſuch perſons as we ſpeak of, have overſeen waking, or elſe have hoped to carry on their deſigne againſt the truth, without attempting any thing by way of alteration, or depravation of the letter of the Scriptures, the divine interpoſall is as evident in either of theſe, as it could have been, in cauſing the higheſt attempts in this kinde to miſcarry.</p>
            <p>But that ſeverall things have been upon advantage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, attempted with the deepeſt ingagement of heart and hand from time to time, either directly or indirectly againſt the Scriptures by the enemies thereof, to overthrow them, is evident by what hath been already ſaid. <hi>Pharaoh drove</hi> as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly as <hi>Jehu,</hi> after the Church of God, to overtake and deſtroy them (and conſequently, the Scriptures with them) when he had them in a body together in the wilderneſſe, untill the wheels of his chariots were miraculouſly taken off by the hand of heaven; and then he ſlaked his pace, and (as the text ſaith) <hi>drove heavily.</hi> They that hid the book of the law in the Temple wall, hoping it would never have been found there, did that which was probable enough to have deprived the world of all further uſe of, or benefit by, it.

And ſo the Emperour <hi>Diocletian</hi> (of whom we ſpake before) after the poor <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with their Religion, had been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly perſecuted, oppreſſed, and waſted by nine ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions in the daies of his predeceſſours, he with a full reſolution to root out <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> with the very remembrance and memoriall of them (if it were poſſible) from under the heavens, meaning (as it ſeems) to doe that by whole-ſale, which the former Emperours attempted to doe by retail; advanceth a perſecution againſt both, with a far higher hand of ſubtilty, cruelty, and bloud, then any of the former had been.

It is true, ſome particular Churches, and ſingle perſons, have rejected ſome parts of the Scriptures, now generally acknowledged for <hi>Canonicall;</hi> but the whole Church never hath been known to doe any ſuch thing.

For it is very poſſible, that neither all which the Prophets wrote, nor whatſoever the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wrote upon any occaſion whatſoever, might be Scripture (in either of theſe ſences) no, nor yet of any more inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from heaven, then thoſe letters were, which <hi>David</hi> wrote to <hi>Joab,</hi> and ſent by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> or then <hi>Peters</hi> practiſe was, for which <hi>Paul reprooved him to his face.</hi> Yet probable it is, that neither the one, nor the other of them (I mean, neither Prophet, nor Apoſtle) wrote much, but what well became men of that ſpeciall intereſt in, and acquaintance with God, which was their crown; but that whatſoever they wrot, was of equall authority, or by any order from God, to be alike imbodied with, or moulded into the Scriptures; hath nothing at all in it ſo much as to invite the belief of a conſidering man. But 2. <hi>Chryſoſtem</hi> and the Greek expoſitours, underſtand that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>I wrot unto you <gap reason="foreign">

And laſtly, concerning thoſe books mentioned, in the old Teſtament, as the book of the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> of <hi>Gad the Seer,</hi> the <hi>Prophecie of Ahijah the Shilonite,</hi> &amp;c. There is no reaſonable (much leſſe any neceſſary) ground, to judge any of them ever to have had the image or ſuperſcription of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture authority upon them, unleſſe (hapily) we ſhall judge concerning ſome of them (as ſome judicious and learned men doe) that they are, either in whole, or in part, ſome of thoſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:111412:141"/> books, which are yet extant, and generally acknowledged by us, for genuine members of Scripture. As for example; ſome conceive, that by the <hi>books of Nathan the Prophet, and Gad the Seer,</hi> is meant nothing elſe, but ſuch particulars concerning <hi>David</hi> and his affairs, which are inſerted in the books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and were drawn up in writing by thoſe Prophets, who had certain knowledge of the truth of them, as being contemporary with <hi>David.</hi> Others think that the whole ſecond book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> with part of the firſt (<hi>viz.</hi> from the beginning of <hi>chap.</hi> 25. where <hi>Samuels</hi> death is recorded) as likewiſe the former book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> were penned by theſe two holy men, <hi>Nathan,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and are therefore called, their <hi>books.</hi> But whether this be ſo, or no, little queſtion there is, but that whatſoever hath at any time been Scripture, is ſo ſtill: and the periſhing of other writings, holy and uſefull in their generation, the Scriptures ſtill remaining, cleerly argueth ſome ſuch difference between the one and the other, as the delivering of Chriſt from under the power of death, or from ſeeing corruption, evinceth betweene him and other holy men, who to this day remaine in the bands and priſon of death.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee, that God hath with an high hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and care, watched over the Scriptures, to keepe them from that ſecond kind of deſtruction, or periſhing we ſpake of, <hi>viz.</hi> from being impaired or diminiſhed in reſpect of any member, or part of them.</p>
            <p>We adde (in the 3. place,) that the ſame God hath with the like hand of providence and care, kept them from that 3. kind of periſhing (which we alſo mentioned) <hi>viz.</hi> from being corrupted or depraved, that is, from any ſuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or change in the words, whether by tranſpoſition, pointing, or otherwiſe, whereby the native or proper ſenſe of them ſhould be impaired, or caſt out, or a ſenſe that is ſpurious or unſound brought in, in the ſtead thereof. What they ſpake in the firſt day of their nativity, in the hour wherein they came forth into the world, out of the womb of the wiſdome and will of God, the ſame things they ſpeake at this day alſo. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaith, that when <hi>he was a child, he ſpake as a child:</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:111412:142"/> and that <hi>when he came to be a man, he put away childiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things:</hi> meaning, that he now ſpake and did like a man. Certaine<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> it is, that the Scriptures in their deepeſt infancie, <hi>spake</hi> neither as <hi>children,</hi> nor <hi>like men.</hi> but like God, and now they are grown to the maturity of many generations, they have not <hi>put away</hi> their divine things; they do not ſpeake either like children, or like men. Looke what treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge they brought at firſt out of the boſome of God with them, the ſame they preſent and hold forth unto the world at this day. God hath ſuffered no man to rob them of their ſilver, or to give them tinne or droſſe in ſtead of it. The words they now ſpeak, are the ſame ſpirit and life, which they ſpake in the beginning. It is true the holy God did not guide all the pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Tranſcribers</hi> of the Scriptures, with the ſame heavenly infallibleneſſe, with which he guided the pens and tongues of his immediate ſecretaries, who tooke and wrote them from his mouth. This appears from that variety and difference of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which is found in ſome words, between copy and copy; which difference of reading, proceeded either from the ignorance or negligence, or (perhaps) from a worſe principle ſometimes in thoſe, who were imployed to tranſcribe them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or as we have a common ſaying, that <hi>the greateſt Clerkes, are not allwaies the wiſeſt men;</hi> ſo neither are the beſt penmen (I meane in point of faire writing,) allwaies either the beſt Clerks, or the moſt carefull and circumſpect men; nor yet the freeſt from corruption. So that men of this faculty being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore (as is moſt probable) chiefly imployed in writing out co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Scriptures, they might eaſily miſtake, one in one word, or in one place, and another in another, and ſo manuſcripts, and copies came to differ one from another in ſome things. But it is one thing for God to ſuffer ſome written or printed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Scriptures to erre, and to miſcarry here and there; another, to ſuffer the import and ſence of the Scriptures to be ſo defaced in all copies whatſoever, that the errour or miſtake ſhould be irrecoverable, either paſt finding out, or healing, by men of diligence and underſtanding. The ſenſe and meaning of many places in Scriptures may be much obſcured, and be made intricate and hard by ſuch and ſuch expoſitours
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:111412:142"/> commenting upon them. Yet this doth not hinder, but that the true and cleer ſence and meaning of theſe places may be attained by conſulting with other expoſitours upon the places; or by a diligent inquiring into, and comparing the Scriptures themſelves. In like manner, poſſibly the true and native ſence of a Scripture, may thorow a miſtake, want, or redundancy of a word in a falſe copy, be paſt finding out, in reſpect of any light which the place miſtaken affordeth thereunto; yet what by the help of other copies or readings, where there is no ſuch miſtake, what by the ſeries and carriage of the context, either before or after the place, or both, and what by the diligent pondering and comparing other Scriptures with it, the dead may be raiſed to life again; the ſence (I mean) of this Scripture, which (like men) was loſt one way, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and ſaved by another. And in this ſence onely we deſire to be underſtood, when we affirm, that God hath preſerved the Scriptures, as well in the integrity and truth of their ſence and meaning; as of their parts and members. Nor can any man reaſonably here object and ſay, But how do I know, when copies, or readings differ, which is the genuine and true, and which the falſe? If the difference be materiall and weighty, the truth between them is ſo much the more eaſie to be found. For as it is in the objects of the outward ſenſes, look how much the more any of them have <hi>deratione objecti,</hi> of that quality or property which makes them the objects of ſuch, or ſuch a ſence, ſo much the more eaſily they are diſcerned; as the more viſibility any thing hath in it, it is ſo much the more eaſie to be ſeen; and ſo in the reſt: ſo is it alſo in the two objects of the underſtanding, truth and errours (eſpecially in matters of Religion.) The greater, and more weighty any truth is, the more intelligibleneſſe it hath in it (which is that that maketh it the object of the underſtanding) and ſo is more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and for the ſame reaſon, the greater or broader an errour is, it is ſo much the more readily diſcovered. If the difference be light, and leſſe conſiderable, though it may be ſo much the greater difficulty to finde on which hand the truth lieth, yet it is ſo much the more like that there is no ſimple or direct errour aſſerted on either hand; but only that there is an
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:111412:143"/> uncertainty of the true ſence and meaning of the holy Ghoſt in that particular place. Now in caſe God ſhould preſerve all and every the particular truths contained in the Scriptures, that none of theſe be loſt; though true expoſitions and meanings of particular places ſhould fail us never ſo much, or be inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to our underſtandings, yet God may be ſaid to preſerve the Scriptures pure and incorrupted. Yea though many of the truths contained in the Scriptures, were not (for the preſent) ſtirring, or on foot in all the world (which I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is the caſe of many of them at this day) yea and though the true ſenſe and meaning of many places in the Scriptures, were not extant in all the world (which I beleeve to be as true, as the other) yet may God be truly ſaid to have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Scriptures from corruption, in caſe the letter of the Scripture be ſo preſerved, that all the truths contained at firſt, or at any time, in the Scriptures, may in a rationall way, and without miracle, be found and drawn out by men. And this is that which we have now under aſſertion and conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath watched with that tender eye of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the letter of the Scriptures, that there was no truth deducible from thence at the firſt coming of them into the world, but that by an equall light of underſtanding, and conjunction with a like hand of diligence, and a like meaſure of aſſiſtance from God, may be alſo deduced from them at this day.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, but how doth this appear? I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. (As before) It is evident that in the daies of our Saviour on earth (as likewiſe in the daies of his Apoſtles after him) there had been no violence offered to the Scriptures in that kinde we ſpeak of, there had been no falſifying of the letter of them. He that had ſo much to doe with the Scribes, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Sadduces, and expounders of the law (yea and with the reſt of the Jewiſh nation) who muſt needs have been the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutours of the Scriptures, if any thing in this kinde had befallen them; and found ſo many corruptions and ſinnes amongſt them otherwiſe, yea and remembred them again and again, of the ſinnes of their forefathers; doubtleſſe would not have gratified ſuch a ſinne as this (forgery, or falſification in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:111412:143"/> records of heaven) with ſilence, if they had been guilty of it. Nay he was ſo farre from charging, either them, or any others, with falſifying, or corrupting the Scriptures, that he ſends them to them, to ſeek for him there; profeſſing, that they gave teſtimony unto him. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think</hi>

Therefore certainly they were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, or polluted then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Jews (as we heard before out of <hi>Philo</hi>) were ſo zealous above meaſure in preſerving the letter of their Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that <hi>there was none of them but would rather die an</hi>

And <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his fifteenth book, <hi>de civ. dei c.</hi> 13. argues to the ſame point thus. <hi>It is not to be beleeved, that the nation of the Jews, ſo farre ſcattered and diſperſed ſome from others, ſhould conſpire together in the ſame deſigne of writing a falſhood; or that envying the authority of the Scriptures unto others, they ſhould deprive themſelves, and their poſterities, of the truth of them.</hi> And concludes: Farre be it from any wiſe man to beleeve or think, that any Jew, or Jews, though never ſo perverſe, miſchievous or malicious, could have any ſuch power over ſo many books, eſpecially being ſo ſcattered and diſperſed in all parts of the world. The ſame reaſon (ſaith <hi>Vives,</hi> upon that place of <hi>Auſtin</hi>) holds good againſt thoſe, who [at this day] to make men beleeve that the truth of Religion cannot be drawn out of the originall fountain of the Scriptures [that ſo they may honour the Roman tranſlation the more] object either that the Scriptures of the old Teſtament are falſified by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, by the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> When the profeſſion of Chriſtianity was once ſcattered farre and neer up and down the world from Eaſt to Weſt, and North to South, and copies of the Scriptures both old and new Teſtament diſperſed accordingly, it was next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, that there ſhould be an univerſall con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:111412:144"/> to have been done, the concluſion which we are now labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to eſtabliſh, will ſtand ſtrong, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath by a great and gracious hand of providence, protected the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſo, that no jot or tittle of the native ſence and import of them is periſhed, but that it is in ſome tranſcript, or other to be found. We ſhewed you before, how, when copies or readings differ, that which is true and uncorrupted, may be diſcerned from the others.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that the originalls of the old Teſtament (in which the ſubſtance of the new is contained; as the ſubſtance of the old likewiſe, is comprehended in the new) are extant in their genuine and native integrity at this day, there is this argument full of proof and conviction. If ſo be the Jews ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have corrupted or falſified their Scriptures (the Scriptures of the old Teſtament) it muſt in reaſon be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they have, either only, or principally falſified them in ſuch places and paſſages, where they moſt favour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Chriſtian Religion, and ſeem to give teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the true and great Meſſiah, or the like; it cannot be imagined, why, or to what purpoſe they ſhould falſifie them, but only to defeat <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the aſſertours of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, of ſuch weapons for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Religion againſt them, which they have been wont to fetch out of their armoury (I mean, their Scriptures, the old Teſtament.) But that they have not falſified them in ſuch places as theſe, is evident by this conſideration; becauſe the Hebrew text, as it ſtandeth, and ſpeaketh at this day, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it ſelf in ſome places more emphatically, with more vigour and pregnancy of expreſſion for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and for <hi>Jeſus Chriſts</hi> being the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> then either the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> tranſlations themſelves doe. Take one brief inſtance in ſtead of more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. where the Greek tranſlation reads, <hi>Take hold of inſtruction,</hi> or diſcipline, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it (as our Engliſh tranſlation preſenteth it) <hi>Kiſſe the Son.</hi> Now this reading comports much better with the faith and doctrine of<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſtians</hi> touching the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom they beleeve to be the Sonne of God, then that other reading of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> doth. All which duly conſidered, that conceit of ſome Papiſts,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:111412:145"/> to entitle the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to a divine intereſt or right, that there ſhould be a generall confluence and meeting of the Jews from all nations under heaven in the City of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> about four hundred and fourſcore years after <hi>Christ;</hi> and that there, out of their hatred to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, they ſhould combine and agree together to falſifie their Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This conceit (I ſay) is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly weak, and hath neither ſubſtance, nor colour, of truth in it; and hath been confuted, hand and foot, ruſh and branch, by Proteſtant writers. Yea there are not wanting among themſelves, men of ſo much wiſdom and ingenuity together, as to diſclaim all part and fellowſhip with that conceit, and to aſſert an indubitable purity in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text, any thing that ever was attempted to corrupt it, notwithſtanding. Yea that great, learned, and famous man amongſt them, <hi>Arias Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> looks upon that convention of the Jews at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> not as many of his fellows look upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> as a meeting intended for, and managed to, the corruption of the Hebrew Scriptures; but as a meeting providentially diſpoſed by God (and no otherwiſe either intended, or managed by thoſe themſelves that met) for the preſervation, and perpetuall ſecurity of the Hebrew fountains of Scripture from corruption.

There are, for matters of faith, and what is to be beleeved, myſteries ſo tranſcendently glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and beautifull, of ſuch a bleſſed aſpect to take, pleaſe, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and raviſh the hearts, and ſouls, and conſciences of men, that a due apprehenſion or right underſtanding of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deliver a man out of the hand of every ſurmiſe and fear, that man, yea or any creature, ſhould have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of them A man may as well, and with as much reaſon, and upon as good grounds, affirm, that ſome ſmith or founder, took a great ball of iron, or braſſe, red hot, or flaming out of a furnace, lifted it up with his arme, and put it into the heavens, and ſo made the ſun, as ſay or think, that a man had any thing to doe in framing the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is the image of God,</hi> even as now it is repreſented, and appears in the Scriptures. And in caſe the world were as wiſe as it ſhould, and might be, by the means vouchſafed unto it by God for ſuch a purpoſe, he that ſhould ſay, there is any thing of men in that myſtery of ſaith, which the Goſpel holds forth and ſhews unto the world, would render himſelf a man of weakneſſe, <hi>one of a thouſand</hi> in ignorance and ſimplicity unto it. And ſo for that other kinde of materiall in the Scriptures, ſuch things (I mean) as relate to manners, and matter of life and converſation, theſe are raiſed to that height and pitch of excellencie and perfection, that it is not lightly (indeed, not poſſibly) incident to the thoughts or apprehenſions of adviſed men, and throughly ſeen in all the particulars, once to imagine, that ſuch principles, rules, and precepts of action, ſhould ever have proceeded from a ſinfull man.</p>
            <p>If any man deſires to know when, or at what time, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall pieces or books of Scripture came to be added to the reſt of the body of them; though I doe not conceive the knowledge hereof would be much beneficiall unto men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that God himſelf hath not thought the revealing of ſuch a thing, worthy his ſpirit, nor neceſſary to the perfecting of the Saints, and fitting them for their glory; yet the beſt and the only way I know for men of this deſire to purchaſe ſatisfaction (the beſt that is to be had) is to conſult with chronologers, a principall part of whoſe work and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:111412:146"/> is, to finde out and diſcover, when, and in what age or year of the world, men that have any waies been famous, and amongſt the reſt, the ancient Prophets and pen-men of the Scriptures, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, when they flouriſhed, lived, and died. It is moſt probable, that the men who received the ſeverall revelations from God contained in the reſpective books of the Scriptures, did withall receive ſpeciall order and direction from him to ſet down in writing, what they had by way of revelation communicated unto them, and withall, to preſent them unto his Church, or the chief head and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof, in his name, as a further in largement of, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition unto, thoſe ſacred records, which he had purpoſed to make a perpetuall and ſtanding treaſury of divine light and knowledge for his Church, in all ſucceeding generations. And this alſo may ſerve to reſolve another queſtion, which ſome may poſſibly ask, <hi>viz</hi> how, or upon what ground, or by what authority, thoſe books, which are now generally received and looked upon as ſo many parts of the ſacred Canon, or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, came to have part and fellowſhip in this honour, ſo many others, for ought is known to the contrary, of equall worth, and poſſibly given by the ſame inſpiration, being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and not taken into this account. For though I doe not know any particular ground in the Scriptures themſelves, on which to frame a poſitive and direct anſwer to this queſtion: yet 1. moſt probable it is, that the perſons whom God made choice of, to be his Secretaries and pen-men, to receive and put down in writing thoſe ſacred dictates of the holy Ghoſt, which he intended for Scripture, had not only an order and command from him, to tender in his name what they had written from his mouth in this kinde, unto his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as that which his will was ſhould be added to his book (which we call the Scriptures) but were further enabled by him, though not alwaies perhaps with a guift of working miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, yet in one kinde, and by one means or other, to convince and give ſatisfaction unto the Church of God, that God indeed had appeared unto them, and that what they did, in offering unto them what they had written, to be accepted as part of the divine Oracles, they did by ſpeciall warrant and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:111412:146"/> injunction from God. And 2. that compleatneſſe and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Scriptures, that ſame all-ſufficiency in them for all holy ends and purpoſes whatſoever, which we formerly argued and proved, is a rationall and cleer demonſtration, 1. That thoſe writings which are now generally received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the name of the Scriptures, are from God. 2. That there needs no further addition to be made unto them by any other immediate or extraordinary revelation from God: and conſequently (in the third place) that if there were any other pieces of divine revelation, beſides thoſe, which now being joined together make up the body, or volume of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, yet it was never any part of the will or pleaſure of God, that any of them ſhould partake in this glory, with the other.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the firſt demonſtration, taken from amongſt the great and famous acts of the Providence of God, to prove that the Scriptures are from God, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſtrange and high hand of protection which he hath held over them throughout all generations, farre above the rate of what he hath done in this kinde, for any other book, or writing, or doctrine, in the world. I have ſtood ſomewhat the longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opening of it, becauſe being duly conſidered in the compaſſe and extent, and all the particulars of it, I judge it to be an argument of that potent conviction, that it cannot (lightly) but on the one hand ſatisfie a conſcience that is ſcrupulous, and on the other hand ſcruple a conſcience that is obdurate, and bent againſt the divine originall of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>My ſecond demonſtration propounded under the former head, was this; the high hand of ſucceſſe, wherewith the Goſpel, even in the infancy of it, and ſoon after it firſt went forth into the world, was attended; the mighty and marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prevailings of it, where ever it came, notwithſtanding the many, and great diſadvantages, which it was to encounter, and overcome, before it could conquer, or ſubdue the hearts or lives of men unto it. When one of the ſpies that were ſent to view the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> repreſented it, and the inhabitants of it as unconquerable, affirming, that the <hi>people were of great
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:111412:147"/> ſtature,</hi> and many of them of the race of the gyants, they but <hi>as graſhoppers</hi> in compariſon of them, <hi>their cities walled up unto heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the very face of theſe great diſcouragements replied notwithſtanding; <hi>fear ye not the people of the land: for they are bread for us:</hi> and ſo they were; for<note place="margin">Numb 14. 9.</note> the Iſraelites ſoon overcame them, and fed themſelves with them, notwithſtanding the mighty arme of fleſh which they had to defend themſelves; but in the mean ſeaſon, this was a great argument and proof, that they had a farre ſtronger arme then their own to aſſiſt them. In like manner when the Goſpel went forth to conquer and ſubdue the world, all things in appearance, threatned a miſcarriage, and defeature of the attempt: the world looked big upon the Goſpel with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn, ſaying to it (in effect) as the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot. This fellow is come alone as a ſtranger, and ſhall he judge and</hi>

               <hi>rule?</hi> They made account, that they being many, and he but one, and that a ſtranger, and ſo not likely to have any party among them, they ſhould doe well enough with him, to keep him under, and not to ſuffer him to have his will, and umpire amongſt them: in like manner, the world, at the firſt coming in of the Goſpel unto it, looking upon it as a ſtranger, a new and a ſtrange doctrine, that had never been taught in the world before, and conſidering how ſolitary and naked it was, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of friends and favourers, who were any waies likely, either for their number, or for their quality, to promote, or protect it; made none other account but they ſhould eaſily <hi>binde the face of it in the duſt</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh) and ſtay the courſe, and ſtop the mouth of it preſently. But all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, though the oppoſitions againſt the Goſpel, and the unlikelyhoods of its ſucceſſe in the world, were of the race of <hi>Anak,</hi> and like unto gyants, and the hopes and means of it's prevailing but <hi>as graſhoppers</hi> (in compariſon) yet the world was but bread for it; all thoſe ſtrong and fiery oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which roſe up againſt it (in the Scripture phraſe) it licked them up <hi>as ox licketh up the graſſe,</hi> and made trophies and triumps of them. And was not <hi>God</hi> now <hi>in the ſtill voice</hi> of the Goſpel, which though like <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it neither <hi>ſtrove, nor cried, nor did any man hear it lift up its voice in the ſtreet,</hi> though
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:111412:147"/> it neither <hi>brake any bruiſed reed, nor quenched any ſmoking flax,</hi> yet did the ſoft words of it break the bones of the world; it <hi>brought forth judgement into victory,</hi> the little ſtrength it had notwithſtanding; <hi>it brought forth judgement into victory. i.</hi> it<note place="margin">Mat 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, 20.</note> made the world at laſt to acknowledge the righteouſneſſe, equity and truth, of that cauſe of God, which it pleaded and maintained; the true <hi>judgement</hi> whereof was for a time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, oppoſed, and ſuppreſſed by the world; it triumphed over the unjuſt <hi>judgement,</hi> and thoſe unrighteous thoughts, wherein the world <hi>rejoyced,</hi> and gloried againſt it <hi>for a ſeaſon.</hi> And in this ſence Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to <hi>bring forth judgement into victory.</hi> My brethren, whilſt the ſound of theſe things is in your ears, doe not your hearts begin to burn within you, with a ſecret ſence and acknowledgement, that doubtleſſe this Goſpel, and ſo the Scriptures which hold it forth unto the world, are from God?</p>
            <p>But to give your ſouls and conſciences their fill in ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if it may be) from the conſideration and demonſtration in hand; we will in ſomewhat a more particular and diſtinct manner lay before you, 1. the great diſadvantages and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelyhoods of ſucceſſe, wherewith that great and glorious undertaking of the Goſpel (to ſubdue and ſubject the world unto it ſelf) was threatned to be made null, and laid in the duſt. 2. How victoriouſly, yea triumphantly notwithſtanding the Goſpel acquitted it ſelf, <hi>ſwallowing up</hi> all impediments, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, enmities, oppoſitions, unlikelihods of ſucceſſe, <hi>into victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt; there are four things (in the generall) which ſeemed to threaten the Goſpel with being non-ſuted, in that great controverſie which it went forth to plead with the world; and to propheſie nothing of that high undertaking, but only that it would be like <hi>the untimely fruit of a woman, which never ſeeth the light of the ſun.</hi> The firſt was, the very tenour, frame and compoſure of the Goſpel it ſelf. The ſecond, the deep and deſperate oppoſition, or contrariety in the natures, hearts, and ſpirits of men againſt it. The third, the weak and contemptible arme of fleſh, which it had to aſſiſt or promote it in the world. The fourth (and laſt) that ſtrong and potent
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:111412:148"/> arme of fleſh, which was every where likely to be, and for the moſt part, was, lifted up againſt it, and the proceedings of it, in the world.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe: The very frame and tenour of the Goſpel, ſeemed to propheſie that little but neglect, oppoſition, and ſcorn, did abide it, in every place where it ſhould come. Five things more eſpecially there are in the frame of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which thus threatned: 1. The foreneſſe and grievouſneſſe of many (and thoſe the main and principall) commands, or injunctions of it. 2. The great unlikelihood of truth or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the promiſes, which ſhould ballance thoſe commands, and make the yoke of them any whit tolerable; the unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood I ſay of truth or certainty in theſe promiſes, according to what fleſh and bloud is likely to judge in ſuch a caſe. 3. The unlikelihood (according to the ſame judgement) that thoſe ſore and terrible threatnings ſhould ever be put in execution, with which diſobedience to the commands of the Goſpel, is charged and threatned. 4. Thoſe frequent abaſings and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications wherein the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tters and declares it ſelf ever and anon, againſt the excellent and honourable things (ſo called, and eſteemed) in the world. 5. (And laſtly) thoſe ſeeming contradictions in the Goſpel, by reaſon whereof it ſeems to make warre againſt it ſelf, and its own acceptation, with reaſonable and conſidering men. Theſe particulars in the frame of the Goſpel, ſeemed, to <hi>write it childleſſe,</hi> and a doctrine that was <hi>not</hi> like <hi>to proſper</hi> in the daies thereof. Let us weigh theſe particulars a little.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the commands, and ſolemn injunctions of the Goſpel, theſe are like <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles (as ſome repreſented them) <hi>fore</hi> and high; they require ſuch things, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely unreaſonable, in the ſence <hi>of fleſh and bloud,</hi> to be demanded of men: they require of men <hi>the one half,</hi> yea the whole <hi>of</hi> thoſe <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of eaſe, pleaſures, honours, riches and injoiments in every kinde, which they have gotten (it may be) with <hi>the ſweat of their brows,</hi> and are fully poſſeſſed of in the world; they require of men to <hi>forſake houſes, and lands, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, brothers and ſiſters, yea and their own lives too,</hi> to expoſe themſelves to the hatred, ſcorne, violence, contempt,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:111412:148"/> and indignation of the world. Now what extream hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are theſe to <hi>fleſh and bloud?</hi> was it like that the delicate ſons, and daughters of the pleaſures and delights of this world, would bear them? So again, we know they command the <hi>wiſemen of the world,</hi> and all thoſe that are ſuch in their own eies, to <hi>become fools,</hi> and to beleeve many ſtrange and unheard of poſitions and concluſions, marveilouſly improbable, yea incredible, till after much debate, conſideration, and inquiry; from which too the very face, and firſt appearance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibleneſſe of the things, ſeem to diſcourage them; as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that God was made man, was born of a virgin, ſuffered thoſe indignities of being reproached and reviled, ſpitted on in the face, buffeted, ſcourged, crucified at laſt on a croſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two notorious malefactours, as a greater malefactour then they, with the like? The Goſpel injoyning wiſe, ſober, grave, learned, acute men, to ſubject their judgements to ſuch notions and opinions as theſe, ſeems to command them out of their ſenſes, wits, reaſons, judgements, underſtandings, and to leave them nothing of men in them. So again; when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, that <hi>when they are ſmitten on the one cheek, to turn the other alſo,</hi> when their <hi>coat is taken</hi> from them, to ſuffer him that takes that, <hi>to take their cloak too;</hi> to <hi>love their enemies,</hi> to forgive injuries, to <hi>pray for thoſe that perſecute them,</hi> &amp;c. they are apt to imagine, that it had as good (in plain terms) command them to turn fools, or to imagine themſelves ſtocks or ſtones. This then is one ingredient in the compoſition of the Goſpel, which ſeems ſo to imbitter it to the taſte of the world, that it would never be digeſted, nor down with men. And yet we ſhall ſee that even ſuch commands and injunctions as theſe, notwithſtanding the harſhneſſe, ſournes, and offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them unto <hi>fleſh and bloud,</hi> were taken down, and digeſted by many thouſands in the world; yea <hi>the Goſpel ran and was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> theſe notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another ingredient in the frame of the Goſpel, which was like to ſet off the world at as great a diſtance as might be, from imbracing it (eſpecially conſidered and compared with the former, the offenſiveneſſe of the commands) is the tenour and ſtrain of the promiſes thereof, eſpecially the great
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:111412:149"/> and main promiſes; which are they that muſt ballance, and weigh againſt the commands, and heal the offenſiveneſſe of theſe, if ever the Goſpel be received by men. Theſe promiſes may very poſſibly ſeem in the eyes of carnall men, to be (in <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe) but <hi>ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> and to have but little <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>life</hi> of truth, or certainty in them. As 1. That great promiſe of juſtification in the ſight of God, unto thoſe that beleeve, upon which all the other promiſes are made to depend; how is the truth of this incumbred and overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch difficulties or objections, which in the eye of reaſon, exerciſed only in the Theories, debates and diſputes of naturall things, and the things of this world, are apt to make the promiſe it ſelf, not ſo much a matter of <hi>doubtfull diſputation,</hi> as of preſent rejection? For 1. That he that is a ſinner, ſhould be made righteous, or innocent at all: or 2. that he that is known to be a ſinner, ſhould be judged and pronounced righteous, or juſt, by a judge of infinite juſtice, and impartiality: or 3. that one man ſhould be made righteous or juſt, by the doings or ſufferings of another; or 4. that many thouſands ſhould be made righteous or juſt, by the doings or ſufferings of one; or 5. that ſuch a juſtification as this, which is obtained by the worth or merit of the doings or ſufferings of another; ſhould be attended with ſuch a glorious and royall retinue of bleſſings, and favours, and great things from God, as to be made his ſons and daughters by adoption, to be freed from the <hi>vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> which ſhall be poured out upon all the world beſides, to be raiſed from the dead, to have <hi>their vile bodies</hi> made excellently glorious, to wear crowns, and to have Kingdomes given unto them (with the like) which are things incredible enough in themſelves, ſimply conſidered; and much more incredible, when they are aſſerted to ſpring from ſuch a root, as the juſtification mentioned is: 6. That only faith, the alone belief of a ſaying reported to come from the mouth of God, ſhould intereſſe a man in ſuch a juſtification, which is attended with ſo many tranſcendencies of bleſſednes and glory, as were mentioned, yea and many more (all which as we know, are comprehended in the promiſe of juſtification, as it ſtands in the Goſpel) all theſe great and ſtrange things (I
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:111412:149"/> ſay) ſtanding round about the great promiſe of juſtification in the Goſpel, makes it ſeem rather (in the eye of the common underſtandings of men) as ſome great King or perſon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour repreſented on a ſtage, then as a promiſe of ſoberneſſe and truth. The promiſe of the reſurrection, ſeemed rather matter of laughter, then of conſideration (much leſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) to Philoſophers themſelves; yea to thoſe of the moſt ſtrict and ſerious ſect amongſt them (I mean the <hi>Stoiques</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17. 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6. 8.</note>) yea the <hi>Sadduces</hi> alſo, a ſect of men profeſſing a knowledge more then ordinary in things appertaining unto God, among the Jews, made little better account of it <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 22. 23.</note>. And (that which is more then all this) ſome Chriſtians and beleevers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who for a ſeaſon had rejoyced under the belief of it, afterwards looking (as it ſeems) too narrowly with a carnall eye upon the improbability of it, took a diſlike of their own belief in this kinde, and reverſed it <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 12.</note>. The promiſe of having <hi>our vile bodies changed, and made like unto the glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Philip. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.</note>, weigheth yet ſome grains more in an unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of performance, then that of the reſurrection. It were eaſie to give inſtance in many others, as obnoxious to diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contempt from naturall men, as theſe.</p>
            <p>A third particular in the very frame and temper of the Goſpel, which might ſeem in the eye of fleſh and bloud to propheſie little but rejection or contempt unto it, on every ſide, inſtead of a prevailing upon, and over, the world, was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the threatnings, whereby it ſeeks to terrifie all the enemies thereof, and thoſe that ſhall oppoſe, or reject it. It threatens ſuch with being caſt <hi>into utter darkneſſe,</hi> where there ſhall be <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth;</hi> with <hi>the worm that never dieth,</hi> with <hi>fire that is unquenchable,</hi> or, that never goeth out, <hi>with a bottomleſſe pit,</hi> &amp;c. Now the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of ſuch threatnings as theſe, and the unlikelihood that ever they ſhould be put in execution, ariſeth from two things: partly from the main occaſion or ground inſiſted upon in the Goſpel, why they ſhould be executed upon men, why men ſhould be ſo puniſhed, as the threatnings import; partly alſo from the nature, kinde or quality of the threatnings or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments themſelves. To begin with this latter; the nature
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:111412:150"/> or kinde of theſe threatnings is ſuch, that to thoſe, who are wont to <hi>judge according to appearance onely</hi> (which is a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity very incident to fleſh and bloud) they ſeem rather like unto the Poeticall figments, of ſuch puniſhments, as they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to their grand malefactours in hell; as to <hi>Siſyphus</hi> his ſtone, <hi>Tantalus</hi> his apples, <hi>Titius</hi> his vulture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are reported and aſſerted by them, not ſo much to terrifie the conſciences of men from evil, as to take the fancies of men with pleaſure and delight in the reading of them; I ſay the threatnings of the Goſpel, to men that are apt to <hi>judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appearance</hi> of things, are more like unto ſuch fables as<note place="margin">Jer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ph. 3. 5.</note> theſe, then unto any thing uttered by the mouth of the living God, or which is any waies like ever to be really performed. Now there are three things more particularly conſiderable, in, and about the nature, quality, or kinde of the Goſpel threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which with men (as was ſaid) were like to make them of no authority or effect. The firſt is, the greatneſſe of them. Secondly, the ſtrangeneſſe of them. Thirdly (and laſtly) the proportion or agreement which they have (though it be not much) with thoſe poeticall and figmentitious puniſhments which we ſpake of.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, The puniſhments threatned in the Goſpel, are ſo above meaſure exceeding great and inſupportable (in caſe they were executed) that men can hardly beleeve, that God being ſo full of love and goodneſſe and mercy (as mens thoughts generally ſuggeſt him to be) ſhould ever deal ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with his poor creature, the work of his own hands, as theſe threatnings import (eſpecially for ſo ſmall an overſight, or miſcarriage, as the non-belief, or neglect of the Goſpel, as we ſhall ſee preſently.) It is a generall rule, that, <hi>Tarda ſolet magnis rebus ineſſe fides.</hi>—Reports of great things in their kinde, are hard to be beleeved. And this is one thing which (as heretofore upon occaſion notice hath been given unto you) that makes the promiſes of the Goſpel ſo hard to be beleeved; I mean the greatneſſe of them. But reports of great things to be done and inflicted by God, by way of judgement upon men, have ſtill found oppoſition and rejection, in way of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, from men; yea and this from men, who were the people of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:111412:150"/> God, and had his Prophets and ordinances, and the miniſtry of his word amongſt them. See <hi>Jeremiah 5. 11. 12. 13. Zeph.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The threatnings, or the puniſhments threatned in the Goſpel, are ſtrange or new, as well as great: and this being in conjunction with the other, is apt to harden the hearts of men with unbelief againſt them ſo much the more. <hi>The worm that never dieth, and the fire that never goeth out, and the pit that hath no bottome,</hi> &amp;c. are new, and ſtrange names of puniſhments unto men; and are more like in the aſſerting or preaching of them, to pleaſe mens humours, in the nature of news, or novelty; then to ſhake their conſciences with fear of enduring them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) that proportion or agreement, which theſe puniſhments threatned in the Goſpel have, or might ſeem to have, which thoſe infernall puniſhments, which the Poets gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſerted in their fabulous relations, and which the world had been a long time accuſtomed to deſpiſe, ſave only for mirth and vain delight ſake (for the Poets themſelves, when they were ſerious, profeſſed that they did not beleeve their own doctrines in this kinde) this agreement (I ſay) as little as it is or was, might well be a preparation, as it were, unto the world, to deſpiſe the threatnings of the Goſpel, when they ſhall come amongſt them. And (haply) <hi>Satan</hi> inſpired his Prophets (the Poets) with ſuch notions of puniſhments in hell, as were mentioned, that ſo he might harden the world (I mean the conſciences of men) againſt the fear of thoſe puniſhments after this life, which the Goſpel threatens againſt thoſe that are the deſpiſers of it. For (as we have had both lately and heretofore, occaſion to obſerve) the devil ſecretly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and teacheth his inſtruments and agents in the world, both to teach and doe, ſuch things, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his members, and agents, have taught, and done; that ſo the world may be puſled, as it were, and at a loſſe to diſtinguiſh and know the one from the other, or otherwiſe be induced thorow the difficulty of diſcerning, to reject both the one and the other. And <hi>Satan</hi> comes to a fair market indeed, if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an but procure the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be caſt out of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:111412:151"/> mindes, and cares, and thoughts of men, though his own things be caſt out with them. But the truth is, that if the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be neglected, or caſt off by men, though ſome particular tenets, or practiſes of <hi>Satan</hi> may poſſibly be caſt off with them, yet the principall things of <hi>Satan</hi> are retained and owned: For that which <hi>Satan</hi> mainly intends and drives at in all his temptations, ſuggeſtions and inſinuations with men, is to allure and draw them into a contempt, or neglect of the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and if he can but get a mans foot into this ſnare of death, it troubles him not much though he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors all other religions beſides; his maxime in this caſe is, that of tyrants; <hi>Pereant amici, dummudò &amp; unà inimici pereant.</hi> So that Chriſtian Religion, which is his enemie, may but down; he cares not though all other Religions, all falſe and idolatrous Religions in the world, which are his friends, ſhould down with it. But this by the way. Thus then ye ſee there are three things conſiderable in the very tenour and frame of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel threatnings, which rendred them very obnoxious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and neglect from men.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto (in the ſecond place) the ſlenderneſſe of the occaſion (as it is apt to ſeem in the eyes of fleſh and bloud) upon which the Goſpel threatnings (according to the conſtant aſſertion thereof) are to be put in execution upon men; and this will ſeem to diſable the authority and credit of them yet much more. We know the Goſpel makes the ſinne of unbelief, if not the only cauſe of bringing <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> and all the reſt of the fearfull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Goſpel upon men, yet a very great and main cauſe hereof, yea from place to place it makes it the cauſe <hi>ſine quâ non</hi> (as they call) the cauſe without which, theſe threatnings ſhall not be executed upon any man, for any other cauſe, or cauſes, reaſon, or reaſons, ſinne, or ſinnes, whatſoever. Now that God, being ſo lovingly and graciouſly inclined unto his creature, as to be ready to forgive him all the reſt of his ſinnes how many in number, how grievous in nature ſoever; yea and not only this, but alſo to conferre upon him a crown of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and glory, only upon condition that he beleeve the Goſpel; that ſuch a God (I ſay) ſhould for, or by reaſon of,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:111412:151"/> the neglect of ſuch a ſmall ſervice as this, execute <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire</hi> upon his creature, and make him everlaſtingly miſerable, and that to the height and extremity and what he is able to ſuffer or endure, in miſery, is a ſaying not like to finde entertainment in the hearts or thoughts of men. Unbelief of the Goſpel, certainly was a new, and ſtrange kinde of ſinne to the world, when it was firſt ſo called and aſſerted by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; it was a ſinne which men had not heard of till then: Therefore to make this the great condemning ſinne of the world; or any ſuch provocation in the ſight of God, that becauſe of it he ſhould bring all mens other ſinnes upon their heads in everlaſting torments and miſeries, ſeems in the eyes of naturall men, to be a ſaying no waies worthy to be received, except it be with rebuke, and ſcorn.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee of how little credit or authority, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Goſpel were like to prove amongſt thoſe, to whom the Goſpel was preached, when it firſt went forth into the world. Now how great a diſadvantage this was unto the Goſpel, to obtain that crown, which it ran for, which was belief, and acceptation, and ſubjection from the world, may eaſily be conceived upon theſe two conſiderations. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any part or paſſage in a relation, or report, which men ſuſpect in point of truth, is to them a ground of jealouſie that the whole is of little better conſtitution; and to be ſuſpected alſo. The Scripture proverb taketh place in this caſe alſo: <hi>a little leven, leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> If ſo be the threatnings in the Goſpel, be, either in their nature, or in reſpect of the occaſion upon which the execution of them is aſſerted, or upon what ground ſoever, of little or no authority or credit with men, they muſt needs incumber and prejudice the authority of the Goſpel in all other the parts and carriages of it. Secondly, the threatnings wherewith the Goſpel is armed againſt all the deſpiſers and neglecters of it, is one part, and that not the leaſt conſiderable, of that ſtrength which it hath, and claims to have, whereby to make its way, and to awaken the conſciences of men, to hearken unto the promiſes of it, and to conſider and to inquire after the truth of them. Some talk much of legall preparations, and being humbled by the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:111412:152"/> law; but the Goſpel hath other manner of inſtruments or engines for the work of humiliation, to ſhake the proud and ſecure hearts and conſciences of men with fear and trembling, then the law hath any (as ſome years ſince upon occaſion, we ſhewed more at large, in the hearing of ſome of you) The threatnings of the Goſpel, which are to follow in the reer of the <hi>great and precious promiſes</hi> thereof, and to cauſe the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of them, through fear to face about, and to turn towards them (if it may be) are upon true account, and in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eye, full of efficacie and power that way; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, muſt needs be (as hath been ſaid) a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of that ſtrength, whereby the Goſpel was to prevail, and to raiſe up a Kingdom for it ſelf amongſt men. It is the nature and property of men yet unconverted unto God (yea and of thoſe too that are converted, in a great meaſure; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> long ſince obſerved) as to deſire the injoyment of things which they apprehend good for them, ſo to deſire an eſcape from things they apprehend evil, <hi>much more.</hi> The fear which often ſeizeth upon men of ſuffering evil, is of a more forcible operation upon them, to ingage them upon a courſe of means to eſcape it, then the love or deſire of a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable poſitive good, is to act them ſutably for the obtaining of it. The reaſon whereof I conceive ariſeth from the ſervile and baſe diſpoſition which is in men. Perſons of a ſlaviſh, and ſervile condition, which condition (commonly) ſoon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the minde and ſpirit alſo <hi>into the ſame image</hi> (I mean of ſlaviſhneſſe and ſervility) being exerciſed and taken up with little, but with fears of being puniſhed, of what they may poſſibly ſuffer and endure, if they follow not their work the better; and having ſmall, or no hopes of obtaining any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive good; hence it comes to paſſe, that deſires of ſuch good as we ſpeak of, are very faint and inefficacious in them; but deſires of that negative good we mentioned, keeping their backs from ſtripes, theſe are potent and operative enough with them, in as much as they have hope by being diligent at their work, to compaſſe this. So is it with the generality of men, eſpecially whilſt they are yet meerly naturall, and carnall; when they hear of heaven, and the glory and great things of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:111412:152"/> the world to come, on the one hand; and of hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and <hi>the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> on the other hand; their fears of being damned in hell, doe commonly prevent and fall to work within them, before their hopes of being made glorious in heaven; yea it is very obſervable, that even the greateſt part of thoſe, who doe in ſome meaſure beleeve (or at leaſt ſeem to doe ſo) manage their religious ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their courſe of devotions, more with an eye unto and out of a ſtrength of deſire to eſcape hell, or to be ſaved <hi>from the wrath</hi> and vengeance <hi>to come,</hi> then out of any ſtrength of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to lift up their heads with the Saints, or to reign with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in glory for evermore. The jaylours firſt queſtion,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 30.</note> being awakened, was, <hi>what he ſhould doe to be ſaved</hi> (Act. 16.) And thoſe that were pricked at the heart at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. though they did not expreſſe themſelves altogether ſo farre, yet the intent of their queſtion certainly was the ſame.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſaved from deſtruction, and the wrathfull hand of God; as in part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer unto them. So now the great labour and travail of the ſouls of poor Chriſtians, the perplexity and diſtreſſe that often is upon their conſciences and ſpirits, is not formally or preciſely through fear of looſing <hi>the great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward,</hi> the glorious benefit and bleſſing of heaven; but through fear of gaining the ineſtimable damage and miſery of hell. This then is a ſecond conſidertion, wherein the Goſpel was much diſadvantaged (as men count diſadvantage) by the unlikelyhood of any reality or truth, in the threatnings thereof; and ſo that which otherwiſe could not but have been one very conſiderable inſtrument, or help to it, to magnifie it ſelf in the hearts and conſciences of men, was by this means much infeebled and diſabled as to action in that kinde. Thirdly, and laſtly, the unlikelihood of truth and certainty in the threatnings of the Goſpel, was in another reſpect very diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious unto it; at leaſt in compariſon of what an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yea or probable truth in them, would have been. For had the threatnings been ſuch, that they might readily or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much inquiry, have been beleeved; then would the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes alſo have hereby gained a good degree to be beleeved
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:111412:153"/> too; and that not only upon this ground, becauſe cleerneſſe or probability of truth in one part of a relation, ſomewhat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth and eaſeth the relation in ſuch other parts of it, which are ſuſpicious and doubtfull; but much more upon this (which the Goſpel it ſelf layeth as a foundation or corner ſtone of its own building) <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no middle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for men or women to be adjudged, or put into by God, for eternity, but either the ſhame and torments of hell, or the everlaſting bleſſedneſſe and glory of heaven. Now of the two, ſimply conſidered, it is much more eaſie to beleeve, that God will not everlaſtingly torment his creature in hell, then that he will everlaſtingly glorifie it in heaven. So that the more credible or eaſie to be beleeved, the Goſpel threatnings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods caſting men into hell, there to endure torment for ever, for ſinne, are, by vertue of the ſaid principle, the promiſes of the Goſpel concerning the eternall ſalvation of men, muſt needs be ſo much the more eaſie to be beleeved alſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Goſpel was much diſadvantaged as to matter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance or belief in the world, from the frame of it, in regard of thoſe frequent abaſements, and vilifications of all worldly excellencies that are found in it: it poures contempt upon the head of the world, and all the glory of it; it throws down all the mountains of earthly honour, riches, pleaſures, wiſdom, and of whatſoever is called great under heaven, and fills up the valleys with them, and makes all but a levell or plain. It takes away all difference between <hi>Jew and Grecian,</hi> between<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note> 
               <hi>bond and free,</hi> between <hi>male and female:</hi> and ſo between rich and poor, honourable, and deſpiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making all to be but <hi>one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The meaning is, that it inveſts all thoſe, without exception, who receive and ſubject themſelves unto it, in an eſtate or condition, ſo ſuper-abundantly glorious and bleſſed, that nothing, any waies relating or appertaining to their preſent condition in the world, whether on the right hand, or on the left, whether convenience, or inconvenience, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or diſ-priviledge, honour, or diſhonour, riches, or poverty, ſtrength, or weakneſſe, health, or ſickneſſe, is any waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, or much to be regarded, in compariſon thereof. It
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:111412:153"/> is only in the time of the night, when <hi>one ſtarre differeth from</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>another in glory:</hi> when the ſun ariſeth in his might, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolveth all thoſe diſtinctions of firſt and ſecond of fift and ſixt magnitudes between them, ſwallowing them up as it were into victory by that abundance of light, which he ſtill brings with him into the world. In like manner, the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt brings that exceſſe of bleſſedneſſe and glory unto men, which drowns all conſideration and thoughts of ſuch differences in their outward eſtates and conditions, which before ſeemed to diſtinguiſh them into mountains and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, into men happy, and men miſerable: even as the vaſtneſſe of the globe or body of the earth, cauſeth the <hi>Mathematician</hi> (who yet uſeth to be very exact and punctuall in his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations) not ſo much as to mention, or take any notice, either of the higheſt mountains, or loweſt vallyes, in his account concerning the figure of it; but pronounceth it perfectly ſphericall, or round, theſe nothwithſtanding. Now Kings and Princes, and the children of the greatneſſe of this world, who (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) <hi>make their neſts amongſt the ſtarres,</hi> and pleaſe themſelves with their prerogative eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the world, were not like to endure any ſuch doctrine or ſpirit which were ever and anon magnifying themſelves againſt their beloved intereſts, of greatneſſe, pomp, and power in the world; repreſenting alſo their perſons as miſerable, as deſpicable, as the pooreſt of men, unleſſe they ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all their earthly glory to the Scepter of Chriſt which was as the ſhadow of death to ſuch men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (And laſtly) the Goſpel in reſpect of the frame of it, was like to ſuffer neglect, and rejection from the world, by reaſon of thoſe ſeeming contrarieties and croſſe paſſages, which at firſt hearing (eſpecially) ſeem to thwart, and fight one againſt another. We ſhall not need to inſtance in ſuch paſſages as theſe; we have done it formerly, once and again upon occaſion; and once (I remember) in the proſecution of the doctrine in hand. We ſhall now only in a word lay before you what diſadvantage the Goſpel was (in reaſon) like to ſuſtain, in point of acceptance with the world, in reſpect of theſe civil warres which it ſeemed to have in its own bowels,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:111412:154"/> thoſe paſſages (I mean) which ſeem to riſe up, and to deſtroy one the other. We have a common ſaying; <hi>mendacem memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem eſſe oportet. i.</hi> A liar had need have a good memory, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt he interfeer in his relation, and ſpeak one thing which doth not agree with another, and ſo looſeth the credit, which he deſires ſhould be given to it. For there is a <hi>genius</hi> or apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the nature of man, not to beleeve any thing reported unto him by another, who is either unknown to him, or known to be a looſe ſpeaker, unleſſe he knows, at leaſt apprehends, better reaſons why he ſhould beleeve what is ſpoken by ſuch an one, then only the credit or opinion he hath of the ſpeaker. And yet much more backward and averſe are men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving upon ſuch terms, when they either know, or apprehend, reaſons why they ſhould not beleeve. Now amongſt all the reaſons or grounds which a man is likely to apprehend to hinder, or take him off from beleeving, what is reported unto him, there is none generally more forcible or prevailing (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with conſidering and underſtanding men) then when that which is reported, is found, or apprehended, to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it ſelf. That of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. is well known:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Dead flies cauſeth the ointment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour: ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wiſdom and honour.</hi> In like manner though a relation or report, hath many things in it worthy conſideration and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſimply conſidered, yet if there be a <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>folly</hi> we ſpeak of, apprehended in it, any thing that is incongruous and inconſiſtent with its fellows, it is enough to make the ſavour of the whole relation to ſtink in the noſtrills of apprehenſive and conſidering men. How much more apt and inclinable are men to take hold even with greedineſſe, of the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch an exception as this, to reject ſuch a doctrine or report, which otherwiſe it burthenſome and offenſive unto them, as the Goſpel generally is unto men, who are yet but naturall and meerly carnall? Thus then we ſee under what diſadvantages the Goſpel went forth into the world, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the very frame and conſtitution of it (and that in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars) and how unlikely it was, in regard of theſe, to finde intertainment or belief amongſt men. This for the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:111412:154"/> firſt of thoſe four diſadvantages, which ſeemed (as was ſaid) to threaten the Goſpel with a generall repulſe by the world, when it firſt went forth to ſubdue it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was the deep and deſperate oppoſition, or contrariety in the natures, in the hearts and ſpirits of men againſt it. The laws, and the precepts and injunctions of it, being all holy, ſpirituall, and heavenly; and the frame of mens hearts, unclean, ſenſuall, and earthly; there muſt needs be a violent antipathy, a fierce contrariety in theſe againſt it; and ſo much the more, becauſe theſe holy, ſpirituall, and heavenly injunctions or laws of the Goſpel, are backed, ſeconded, and ſtrengthened with thoſe terrible penalties or threatnings we ſpake of, and that with authority. Men, who have a long time<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 24.</note> been <hi>like wilde aſſes accuſtomed to the wilderneſſe, and to ſnuffe up the winde at their pleaſures,</hi> have <hi>walked</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>in the vanity of their mindes,</hi> and done little elſe all their daies but <hi>fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> cannot endure to hear of a yoke of righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, to be put about their neck; much leſſe, that for kicking at it, or caſting it off, they ſhould be everlaſtingly tormented; ſuch things as theſe are <hi>very ſwords</hi> to them, <hi>which paſſe through their ſouls. He that doth evil,</hi> our Saviour ſaith, <hi>hateth the light, neither</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>cometh he to the light</hi> (nor willingly ſuffereth the light to come to him) <hi>leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> Certain it is, that men naturally doe not love to have either their deeds, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reproved; 1. becauſe they are jealous of their credits, and reputations; and a reproof ſeems to carry ſome diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſparagement with it. And 2. men love to have a good opinion of their waies and practiſes; otherwiſe their conſciences would be troubleſome unto them. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tendency of a reproof, is to bring men out of love with ſuch waies and practiſes, for which they are reproved: and theſe being ſuch, which they are no waies willing to relinquiſh, the reproof of them muſt needs be a ſecret wound, a ſoar and deep cut to them; and conſequently, the Goſpel muſt needs be hatred in the higheſt unto thoſe, that walk in ſuch waies, becauſe it is the ſharpeſt and ſoreſt reprover of them under heaven. For it both manifeſts and diſcovers the vileneſſe, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:111412:155"/> guilt of ſinne to the uttermoſt, farre beyond any diſcovery that can be made by another means, or light whatſoever; and then alſo threatens it with a puniſhment, which in torment and grievouſneſſe to be endured, exceeds all puniſhments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, if it be not repented of, and reformed. Which two ingredients muſt needs make a reproof of the ſharpeſt, and leaſt ſufferable conſtitution, that can be. That contrariety in the hearts and ſpirits of men againſt the Goſpel, which we now ſpeak of, the Scriptures and Goſpel it ſelf take full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the rulers</hi>

They were, the <hi>bands and the cords, i.</hi> the holy laws, and righteous precepts, the directions and injunctions of the Goſpel, wherewith God and his Chriſt, and in his Chriſt, ſought to binde them to their good behaviour, and to make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto heaven, that thus enraged them, and occaſioned this <hi>conſultatio magna,</hi> this great and generall conſultation, not onely to <hi>break</hi> them <hi>aſunder, i.</hi> (I conceive) by laws and edicts, and cruell threatnings to forbid the preaching of the Goſpel, and to ſuppreſſe it, once, and again; but alſo <hi>to caſt them away from them; i.</hi> to make ſure, if they knew how, never to be troubled with it more; however this they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, by ſeeking to make havock and deſolation of all that was called <hi>Chriſtian</hi> upon the face of the earth, by moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloudy perſecutions.</p>
            <p>Nor did this fierce oppoſition and contrariety to the Goſpel, work only in the breſts and ſpirits of <hi>Kings, and rulers of the earth;</hi> though here (it is like) it was boiled up to the greateſt height, and ſtrength, and ſhewed it ſelf from hence with the greateſt terrour, and pomp of indignation; but the ſpirit we ſpeak of, wrought effectually alſo in perſons of lower rank and quality.

So that evident it is, that not only perſons of ſome ſpeciall rank or intereſt in the world, but men of all ſorts and conditions, even the whole world, ruſh and branch, head and tail, were full of enmity againſt the Goſpel.

Now under what greater diſadvantage is it (almoſt) imaginable that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould attempt the conqueſt of the world, then this; to have no man (to ſpeak of) a friend to it, or that was willing to aſſiſt it, in this great enterpriſe; but to finde the whole world (in a manner) up in arms to oppoſe it, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the life of it? Never was there any enterpriſe underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by man upon the like terms of diſadvantage; and yet how gloriouſly did this undertaking proſper in the hand of thoſe to whom it was committed? A great part of the world in a ſhort time was taken, and led away in captivity by it.</p>
            <p>The third (and moſt conſiderable) diſadvantage, under which the Goſpel undertook the reducement of the world, was the ſlender and weak arme of fleſh, which it had to ſtand by it,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:111412:156"/> and take part with it, to protect it againſt the rage and fury of ſo many potent adverſaries, as magnified themſelves againſt it (almoſt in every place) and to carry on the work of it in, the face of that fiery and puiſſant oppoſition, which was made by the world from all the quarters thereof. Who, or what were the men with whoſe aſſiſtance and help, the Goſpel undertook that great and glorious undertaking we ſo often mention, the ſpirituall conqueſt of the world? What were their numbers? of what familie, deſcent, and bloud? of what educations, accompliſhments, or endowments, were they? were they a numerous, and potent hoſt, or army, that could bear down whole nations and kingdoms before them, and by force of arms, give laws to what ſtate or people they pleaſed? and plant their doctrine by the terrour of the ſword? No, they were at firſt but twelve men; and if they had been twelve times twenty thouſand (eſpecially ſuch as they were) what had this been for the conqueſt of the world? Nor were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ſwords, or ſuch like weapons and engines of the fleſh, choſen by them, or by any direction from them, for Church officers, or for a life-guard to the Goſpel (though now they have this honour caſt upon them) nor was the favour of earthly Princes, or civil magiſtrates coveted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> either for the ſupport of the honour and dignity of their calling, or by way of advantage for the planting or propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Goſpel, though they were no more in number, but twelve men. Well; but though their number was inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet this (poſſibly) was recompenced by the quality, or intereſt of their perſons. Theſe twelve (may be) were the ſons, or elſe of the houſe and lineage of thoſe famous Kings and Princes, who were adored by the world, as gods, having been their great benefactours, as of <hi>Jupiter, Hercules,</hi> or the like: and by reaſon of their relation in bloud to ſuch Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours, as theſe, the world might more willingly come in unto them, and receive the doctrine and laws, that they ſhould bring unto them, and deſire them to accept. No, they were the moſt of them (if not the whole number) perſons of mean and ordinary parentage, poor fiſher-men, unknown both they and their parents, and progenitours unto the world; yea they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:111412:156"/> were of that nation, and family in the world, of which neither <hi>Jupiter,</hi> nor <hi>Mercury,</hi> nor <hi>Hercules,</hi> nor any other of their gods, either great, or ſmall, were ever reported to have come. But it may be they were men of choice education and parts: they had ſome rare accompliſhments of learning, arts, ſciences above other men; and ſo might <hi>take</hi> the world <hi>by craft,</hi> or ſubtilty of deviſe; by magique charms, incantations, deluſions, or the like. Indeed <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> ſaid that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were the moſt expert in magique of any that ever lived: and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrot a ſpeciall book of this profeſſion, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it unto <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and that by this means they enchanted the world. But alas! the Apoſtles, were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of no ſuch education or breed: they were ſo farre from any excellency or depth in any humane ſcience, or learning, that their adverſaries themſelves diſcovered them to be ignorant,<note place="margin">Act. 4 13.</note> and unlearned men (in reſpect of any ſuch learning.) They were brought up in the trade and imploiment of fiſhing, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of them, all their daies, till they were called to be Apoſtles; yea after three years converſe, and more, with Chriſt himſelf, even till his death, notwithſtanding thoſe many rich and bleſſed opportunities they had of gathering knowledge in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from his lips, who was ever and anon ſpeaking <hi>the words of eternall life</hi> unto them, yet it appears by their queſtions and demands, that they had learned very little of the myſtery of the Goſpel; yea by ſome expreſſions that came from them, it might reaſonably have been thought, that they had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncapable of the knowledge of it. That knowledge or learning, which they had afterwards, of what kinde ſoever it was, the world neither knew <hi>whence it came, nor whether it went,</hi> or was like to goe. Thus then you ſee, the Goſpel went forth in that great expedition to ſubdue the world, under the greateſt diſadvantage that lightly could be, in reſpect of any collaterall help, or ſtrength from men alſo.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto (in the fourth and laſt place: for we ſhall paſſe by the fift particular mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in the Goſpel, as having ſpake ſomewhat to theſe formerly in the point) the conſideration of thoſe numerous and potent enemies in every kinde, which every where beſtirred
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:111412:157"/> themſelves, made head againſt the Goſpel, to keep off the dint and ſtroke of it from themſelves, and all thoſe, with whom they had to doe; and then by means of this, and the three former conſiderations, you will have an opportune ſtanding to behold the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel in the glory of it, when it advanced firſt out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon that moſt honourable and bleſſed deſigne, to ſubdue the folly and madneſſe of the world, and to give laws of life an righteouſneſſe, and true wiſdom unto it. There were two ſorts of enemies more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, which as they were (more generally) fuller of enmity and of an hoſtile ſpirit againſt the Goſpel, then others, ſo had they opportunity above others to act this enmity of theirs with greateſt danger (at leaſt, with greateſt likelihood of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) to the Goſpel, having indeed the generality of the world between them at their command, eaſie to be drawn by them, to give their aſſiſtance unto any thing, wherein by theſe men it ſhould be deſired. The firſt of theſe, were <hi>Kings and Rulers of the earth,</hi> men armed with ſecular authority and power. The latter, were <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and oratours, the wiſe and learned and eloquent men of the world. We ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the former of theſe in another conſideration: now we are to look upon them, as perſons riſing up in their might, and acting with an high hand in every place againſt the Goſpel, to keep it out of their reſpective dominions, and conſequently out of the world. So that as God upon the fall of man, ſet an <hi>Angel with a flaming ſword, to keep</hi> the world out of his <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> ſo doe the world <hi>ſet</hi> many <hi>Angels,</hi> many <hi>Kings and Princes,</hi> as it were, <hi>with flaming ſwords,</hi> to keep God himſelf (in his Goſpel) out of their <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> I mean their earthly kingdoms, and dominions. That which <hi>David</hi> ſpake long before by the ſpirit of Propheſie, concerning the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> ſetting themſelves, and the <hi>rulers taking counſell together againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed,</hi> was fulfilled, when the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> firſt set out upon his <hi>white horſe</hi> (the Goſpel) to ſubdue and <hi>conquer</hi> the world. This the Apoſtles themſelves, took knowledge of, when they began but to publiſh and preach the Goſpel openly in the world. The powers of the earth were preſently up, as it were, in arms
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:111412:157"/> to oppoſe them in their way, <hi>taking it grievouſly</hi> (as the text ſaith) <hi>that they taught the people, and preached through Jeſus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>the reſurrection of the dead. Yea they preſently laid hands on them, and put them in hold,</hi> or in priſon; and calling them before<note place="margin">verſ. 18.</note> their tribunall, they <hi>ſtraitly commanded them that they ſhould in no wiſe ſpeak or teach in the name of Jeſus.</hi> Upon occaſion whereof, the Apoſtles, amongſt other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> praiſing God for bringing them off with their lives and liberties, mention that propheticall paſſage of <hi>David,</hi> which we ſpake of. <hi>And when they heard it</hi> (ſaith the text, <hi>viz.</hi> in what danger <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had been, in regard of the high diſpleaſure of<note place="margin">Act. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Again in the following chapter, the chief Prieſts with their complices, were filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the Apoſtles for preaching the Goſpel, that (as the text ſaith) <hi>they took counſell to ſlay them.</hi> As the <hi>Princes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5. 33.</note> 
               <hi>and rulers</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> began, and led the way, ſo did the Kings and rulers of other nations for ſome hundreds of years together follow, every where magnifying themſelves with all their power and policy, with all cruelty and bloud, againſt the Goſpel, making ſevere edicts and laws againſt thoſe, that ſhould either preach, or profeſſe it; yea proſecuting and purſuing them up and down the world, with ſlanders and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, with ſpoilings and confiſcations of goods: with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, with baniſhments, with deaths, and thoſe the fulleſt of ſhame and torment, that they could deviſe; and all, to ſecure their palaces, their towns, their cities, their kingdoms againſt the Goſpel, that it might not get within them, or at leaſt might ſoon be caſt out, ruſh and branch, from amongſt them, if at any time, notwithſtanding all their diligence and watchfulneſſe, and way-layings, it ſhould come in unto them. They made partition walls of fire, and ſwords, and bloud, between their territories, and the Goſpel; to keep the one from coming at the other. It would be a long work, and take up much time to relate particularly what the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intimate, and other hiſtories of the primitive times relate,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:111412:158"/> concerning the ſubtile, politike, the violent and bloudy practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in every kinde, that were ſet on foot, and managed with all induſtry and diligence, by the <hi>rulers of the earth,</hi> and their officers and agents, to keep the Goſpel down; that it might not propagate, nor lift up its head in the world. We have given you an account of theſe things in the generall, and ſhall content our ſelves herewith for the preſent; leaving the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to your own inquiry, and conſideration. Again</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ſort of enemy, as deſperately bent againſt the Goſpel, as the former, and having as much (if not more) advantage in his way, to ſet the world at the greateſt diſtance from it in their affections, is the generation of the wiſe and prudent, of the learned and eloquent, of the great <hi>diſputers of this world.</hi> The Goſpel was as great an offence, and matter of indignation unto theſe men, as unto the other; and theſe by means of their endowments of wit, learning, eloquence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were unto the others, as drums and trumpets are to ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when by their warlike notes and ſounds, they fill their breſts with martiall courage and reſolution, againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. So did the heathen oratours and Philoſophers, the one by their eloquence, the other by their arguments and diſputes, caſt oyl upon the flames, and made that enmity and hatred againſt the Goſpel, which was already kindled in the breſts of Kings, to break forth into a raging and devouring fire. <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> reports of a Philoſopher in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who writing againſt Chriſtians, poured out himſelf in the praiſes of perſecuting Princes. Many ſuch paſſages there are upon record in eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall hiſtories.</p>
            <p>Nor had they by the means aforeſaid, this potent influence upon Kings and Princes alone, to ſet them on fire againſt the Goſpel; they had the like, or greater opportunity to way-lay the Goſpel in the judgements and apprehenſions of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men, by repreſenting it unto them, not only as a doctrine, that would expoſe them to the diſpleaſure of their Princes, and be the cruſhing and undoing of them, and their families and poſterities in that kinde; but alſo as a doctrine of vanity, that had no ground-work in reaſon for the bottom or foundation of it, as a doctrine incumbred with a thouſand
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:111412:158"/> abſurdities, and impoſſibilities, a doctrine more like unto a <hi>deviſed fable,</hi> then to a ſubſtantiall truth; and in this reſpect, not more generally, then deſervedly, rejected and abhorred by the world. It is no hard matter for men of parts, learning, wit, eloquence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to declaim againſt any thing how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſoever; and to repreſent that, which is ſimply, and in it ſelf, unblamable, as notoriouſly monſtrous and foul: as it is eaſie for a cunning Painter to make the ſoundeſt and firmeſt timber that is, look like rotten wood, by colouring it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; or to disfigure the beſt countenance and faireſt face, into a meer deformity. Eſpecially when ſuch men as we ſpeak of, men of wit and eloquence, have to doe, either with men that are weak and injudicious, and inconſiderate withall; much more, when they have to plead, or to promote ſuch a cauſe, which ſuits with the deſires and inclinations of thoſe, to whom they addreſſe themſelves in this kinde; and moſt of all, when their task is, only to perſwade men from that, which if they doe imbrace, or own, they know, or at leaſt have great cauſe to fear, will be deſtructive to their peace and comfort, yea to their very lives and beings in the world; I ſay when men of wit, and learning, and parts otherwiſe, are to deal with the judgements and affections of men upon ſuch terms of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as theſe, it cannot in reaſon be thought, but that they may very eaſily prevail, and carry their deſire and deſigne in this caſe, cleer before them, whatſoever it be. Now the heathen Oratours and Philoſophers we ſpeak of, who were deſperate enemies unto, and oppoſers of the Goſpel, had generally all theſe advantages, to take off the judgements and affections of the world from it, yea and to turn their hearts againſt it. For firſt, the men of the world, with whom they had to doe in this kinde, were (generally) w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ak and low in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt in ſuch things, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ended to the honour, credit, and countenance of the Goſpel; and in reſpect of ſuch things as theſe, inconſiderate withall. Secondly, the diſparagement of the Goſpel, as being a fable, or a lying doctrine, was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their corrupt natures, and ſinfull deſires and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ſouls. Men (generally) were marvellouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and inclined ſo to judge of it; and deſirous to have
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:111412:159"/> reaſons and grounds, upon which they might with confidence and ſecuritie, ſo judge of it. Thirdly, and laſtly, the men whom they ſought to poſſeſſe with hatred and enmity againſt the Goſpel, knew very well of what evil conſequence it was like to be unto them, if they did own it, or make profeſſion of it: that it was like to be the ruine of their peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the world. All which conſidered, it is a wonder of wonders, duly conſidered, that ever the Goſpel ſhould get footing, much more, that ever <hi>it ſhould run, and be glorified</hi> (as the Apoſtles expreſſion is) in the world; and that, what between the bloudy rage and fury of Kings and Princes on the one hand, and the bitter and ſubtile diſputes and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Philoſophers and oratours on the other hand, <hi>inter aſtutiam ſuadendi, &amp; duritiam ſaeviendi</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath it) it ſhould not, as between two milſtones, have been ground to pouder. But behold the finger and mighty power of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Goſpel, which was ſo mightily diſadvantaged in it ſelf, I mean in the frame and conſtitution of it, having ſo little therein (as we have ſeen) to commend it unto the world: which had ſo little help from men, ſo ſlender an arme of fleſh (as we heard) to ſtand by it, or promote the cauſe of it in the world; nay, which had ſo many great and Potent enemies to oppoſe it, who dealt furiouſly on the one hand, and ſubtilly on the other hand, againſt it; yea which had (in a manner) the whole world, as one man, up in arms againſt it; this Goſpel (I ſay) hath made its way through the midſt of all their fierce and fiery oppoſitions, hath thrown down mountains on the right hand, and mountains on the left, and hath built her ſelf a throne in the midſt of the earth, and <hi>rules the nations with a rod of iron.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his time took ſpeciall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the wonderfull ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, in every place whether he carried it, againſt all oppoſitions and gainſayings of men. <hi>Now thanks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be unto God which alwaies</hi>

So that the <hi>three pecks</hi> in which the <hi>leven</hi> of the Goſpel, was <hi>hid, i.</hi> the three parts of the world (being all of it that was then known) <hi>Aſia, Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> ſoon came to be <hi>levened</hi> with it. Alas! <hi>the Kings and rulers of the earth,</hi> as well they that ruled it by power, as they that ruled it by wit and ſubtilty, when they conſulted the obſtruction of the Goſpel, <hi>they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) but <hi>a vain thing.</hi> Their conſultations were but fleſh, and their horſes and chariots were but fleſh: but the counſells, by which the Goſpel advanced in the world, were ſpirituall; and the guard of it were <hi>chariots and horſes of fire in the mountains:</hi> ſo that it <hi>laught</hi> all that pomp and terrour of oppoſition, wherewith it was reſiſted by the world, <hi>in the face to ſcorn.</hi> It took no knowledge of the leopards, or lions, or bears, that were in the way of it: and <hi>Leviathan</hi>-like, it <hi>eſteemed iron, as ſtraw, and braſſe, as rotten wood.</hi> The bloudy edicts of Emperours and Kings <hi>could not make it flee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 41. 27.</note> or keep back: and fire and ſword were <hi>turned with it into ſtubble.</hi> It leaped over the walls of their cities, it brake into their forts and caſtles, yea it found a way into the palaces and chambers of Kings and Emperors themſelves, and took hold of thoſe that ſtood at their right hand, even whilſt they were breathing out fury and death againſt it. When they let it alone it proſpered; when they perſecuted it, and that unto death, it proſpered yet more; in ſo much that they were at their wits ends, what to doe with it; or how to break the courſe and proceedings of it. One while they would give it reſt and peace, as it were, to ſee whether <hi>proſperity</hi> would not ſlay it.

And may we not by this time, taking all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that hath been delivered in the point, ſay concerning it, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Chriſt. Rabbi, we know thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can doe the miracles, or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which thou doeſt, except God be with him?</hi> Have we not foundation and ground in abundance from the mighty and<note place="margin">Joh 3. 2.</note> wonderfull works which the Goſpel wrought, in, and upon, the hearts of ſuch infinite numbers, both of men and women in the very face, as it were, of ſuch aſtoniſhing and devouring oppoſitions, to build this concluſion, with the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that may be, upon; that certainly this Goſpel comes from God; and that no doctrine under heaven <hi>could doe the works, which</hi> it hath done, <hi>except God be with it?</hi> Had not God ſtood by it, when it was at work, and helped it to pull, could it ever have drawn to it the hearts and mindes and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſo many millions of men and women, rich and poor, old and young, as we have heard it hath done, againſt ſuch potent detentions, and pullings back; againſt ſo many mighty ingagements of fleſh and bloud, all drawing and haling a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way? If a man ſhould ſee a veſſel or a ſhip runne ſwiftly upon the waters, quite againſt the tide, and ſtream, and a ſtrong gale of winde, would he not preſently ſay, that there is an inviſible force or power, greater then that of the tide, and ſtream, and winde, put together; that carrieth her along, and gives her this motion? In like manner, the Goſpel bearing up with a ſwift and irreſiſtible courſe, againſt the natures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, againſt the fury and bloudy perſecutions, againſt the policy and ſubtile oppoſitions of the world, it cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be conceived, but that <hi>the ſtarres in their courſes</hi> carried it
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:111412:161"/> along with them, and that the power of the Almighty wrought with an high hand in the progreſſive motion of it, upon ſuch<note place="margin">Heb. 11, 12.</note> terms. The Scripture (ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>) ſaith, that <hi>there ſprang of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the ſtarrs of the skie in multitude, and as the ſand which is by the ſea ſhore innumerable.</hi> So may it be ſaid concerning the Goſpel; it was at firſt but as a <hi>dead</hi> doctrine, in appearance, having neither ſpirit, nor life, nor power of generation in it: yet have there ſprung from the loins of it a generation of ſons and daughters ſo numerous, that both heaven and earth are repleniſhed with them.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected and ſaid; that neither is a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor yet a large-ſpreading propagation of a doctrine, or Religion, any argument of aſſurance, that either the one, or the other, is of a divine originall, or from God: for then the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion, the law or doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> claim this honour, of being from God too; for this alſo ran, and propagated, and made <hi>proſelytes</hi> in abundance in the world; drew in many nations, and Kingdomes, into a ſubjection and obedience to it; as is famouſly known at this day. To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That the weight and ſtrength of the argument laſt inſiſted upon, to demonſtrate the divinity of the Scriptures, did not ſimply ſtand, either in a ſpeedy, or plentifull propagation of the Goſpel; but in theſe, under ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, againſt all thoſe diſadvantages, and unlikelihoods of ſucceſſe, which were mentioned. So that though neither the one, nor the other of theſe, ſimply conſidered (I mean, neither the ſpeedy, nor yet the abundant ſpreading, or propagating of the Goſpel) be any argument neceſſarily concluding the divine authority of the Scriptures; yet either of them (and much more both together) being in conjunction with ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, may be ſufficient to evince, and reach, ſuch a concluſion. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born of a woman, doth not prove any thing miraculous, or above the courſe of nature, in his conception: but that the ſhould be born of a woman, which was a virgin, and had not known a man, this evinceth it. That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould walk ſafely upon dry land, did not prove
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:111412:161"/> any thing more, then an ordinary hand, or preſence of God with them, but that they ſhould walk upon dry land ſafely; in the midſt of the ſea, the waters ſtanding like a wall on the right, and on the left hand, this did abundantly prove it. In like manner, though the fruitfulneſſe of the Goſpel in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſons and daughters in the world, was neither in reſpect of the ſuddenneſſe, nor of the abundance hereof, any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of any peculiar relation in it unto God; yet the coincidence of ſuch circumſtances, as have been expreſſed, with theſe, may together advance a ſufficient, yea an abundant, proof in this kinde. And if the doctrine or religion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> could plead a fructification in the world upon the like terms, which the Goſpel doth; doubtleſſe the proof or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration would be unpartiall, and evince the one as well as the other, to be from God. But great are the differences on the one ſide, and on the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The doctrine or Goſpel of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was fitted to the naturall inclinations, luſts, and corruptions of men; it every waies comported with men in theſe; whereas the Goſpel (as we heard) handles theſe with all ſeverity and roughneſſe; ever and anon injoining the crucifying, and prohibiting the fulfilling of them; urging and preſſing upon men, with all authority and power, things that are of the moſt cutting nature, and ſharpeſt contrariety unto them. The ſtory ſaith, that <hi>Mahomet ſet on foot his new religion, to bring light unto the Gentiles, and to mitigate to the Jews and Chriſtians the ſeverity of the law, and of the Goſpel.</hi> He conſidered (it ſeems) where, and in what particulars, the Goſpel ſuffered diſadvantage, in reſpect of the generality of men; what it was that made the doctrine of it ſo offenſive to the greateſt part of the world; and all ſuch things as theſe, he either left out, or altered the nature or property of them in his law, and ſubſtituted things pleaſing to corrupt nature in their ſtead. He gratified men in his law, with plurality of wives, to what number they pleaſed; gave them liberty to put them away, and exchange them, as oft as they pleaſed: made it lawfull for men to revenge inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: taught that men are not bound by their oaths before God, except they ſwore from their hearts; with many other
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:111412:162"/> like things of a wicked confederacy with the vile and ſinfull hearts of men. So that whereas, God, the authour of the Goſpel, for the compoſure and frame thereof, did, as it were, goe round about the corrupt hearts and natures of men, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and obſerving all the inordinate affections, corrupt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and ſinfull propenſions and diſpoſitions thereof, that ſo he might make and temper his Goſpel to meet with, and ſtrike at them all; <hi>Mahomet</hi> on the contrary, took cognizance of them, that in the compoſure of his Goſpel, he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them, and ſpeak to their hearts.</p>
            <p>So that if <hi>Mahomets</hi> Goſpel prevailed farre and near, and made the <hi>world</hi> to <hi>wonder after it,</hi> there is no great, no ſtrange thing in it: it went along with men in the waies and deſires of their hearts; and what ſhould hinder, but that they ſhould goe along with it? when <hi>two are agreed,</hi> it is no ſtrange thing to ſee them <hi>walk together.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome men,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 3.</note> who though they cannot <hi>endure ſound doctrine,</hi> are yet apt enough <hi>to heap up teachers to themſelves, according to their luſts;</hi> ſo likewiſe is a doctrine, or teacher, that is unſound, likely enough to <hi>heap up</hi> auditours, and followers in abundance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their luſts and fancies; I mean, thoſe corruptions and looſe opinions, which are held forth, and taught by them. But as it was a greater thing, and a more demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the extraordinary power and preſence of God, that one man ſhould be conceived and brought forth by a virgin; then that all the men that have been in the world beſide, ſhould be brought forth in the ordinary way of propagation; ſo that any one, or the ſmalleſt number of men, ſhould be made true proſelytes by the Goſpel, and cleave unto and follow that in the world, is a far greater and more conſiderable thing, and more demonſtrative of the gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſence of God with it, then that the doctrine and law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould draw the whole world (in compariſon) after it. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mahomet is carnall,</hi> and the world is carnall, ſo that there is a ſymbolicall quality, a principle or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in this law with the world: but the law of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Goſpel is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and ſo in reaſon like to prove nothing, but hatred and enmity unto the world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:111412:162"/>2. There is this ſubtile and carnally politique device in the law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to make proſelytes of men laden with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and vanities (eſpecially being injudicious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate withall, which was the condition of the greateſt part of the world when this law moſt prevailed;) Firſt there are in this law, many precepts and injunctions unto things morally vertuous and good, which are apt to commend it much to the, naturall conſciences of men: as prayers unto God, faſtings almeſ-deeds, juſtice, temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and againe many ſins againſt the light of nature, as covetuouſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, adultery, deceit (eſpecially practiſed upon Orphans) and ſo ſwearing and foreſwearing, with ſome others of like nature, are ſorely threatned with the diſpleaſure of God, and fire of hell. Thus far the naturall conſciences of men are charged and burthened with this Law; which charge notwithſtanding is none other, then what lay upon them before, in thoſe naturall impreſſions of things morally honeſt and diſhoneſt, which God hath planted in them. But then ſecondly, though this doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> thus chargeth the conſciences of men, and threatens tranſgreſſours ſorely yet it hath a way very pleaſing to fleſh and blood, to exonerate and diſcharge them againe, when they ſhall tranſgreſſe and do contrary to the things commanded; <hi>viz.</hi> certaine carnall penances or compenſations that are more eaſie and neare at hand (wherein the religion of Rome much ſympathiſeth with it,) as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, about the caſe of perjury, there is this declared, <hi>that they that forſweare themſelves, ſhall have no good thing in the world to come.</hi> But elſewhere this burthen is eaſed by ſuch a <hi>proviſo,</hi> or clauſe of mitigation as this; that <hi>to redeeme an oath</hi> (as the law calleth it) <hi>i e.</hi> either to purchaſe a liberty to act contrary to an oath, or to redeeme a mans ſelf from under the danger or guilt of having broken an oath, <hi>they muſt feed or cloath ten poore men, or fast three daies.</hi> Other inſtances of like nature might be produced, but we cannot inſiſt upon particulars. Generally to goe into the wars, and to be valiant and couragious there, is made an univerſall attonement for all ſins, and carries their paradiſe planted with all ſenſuall delights, and pleaſures, with a ſtrong hand before it, againſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:111412:163"/> all wickedneſſes and villanies whatſoever. Now ſuch a conſtitution and temper of a doctrine or law, as this, <hi>viz.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there ſhall be ſome things commanded, which are apt to commend it to the conſciences of men, as juſt, and holy, and good; and other things againe preſcribed of an eaſie purchaſe or procurement to relieve and eaſe the conſciences of men, under the ſtroake of the guilt of ſin, muſt needs be conceived very apt and likely to take with the generality of men, and to carry the ſinfull, ſenſuall, and ignorant world before it, becauſe it gratifies both conſcience and concupiſcence at once in ſuch men; yea and that part of it wherein it gratifies conſcience, I meane wherein it commands things agreeable to the morall impreſſions in the conſciences of men, is a confirmation by way of comfort unto them, that that part of it alſo wherein it gratifies concupiſcence, and gives men hope of eſcaping puniſhment, without mortification of their ſins, is a truth approved of, and aſſented unto by God. So that in this conſideration alſo the doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> had a maine advantage and likelihood of propagating it ſelf in the world, which the law of God, and of Chriſt in the Goſpel, had not. This law admits of no carnall or fleſhly attonement for ſins committed: nor doth it give any hope of the pardon of ſins from the hand of God, unto thoſe that have committed it upon any attonement whatſoever, without the mortification of it <hi>in our members,</hi> at leaſt in ſome degree. Therefore in this reſpect alſo the great prevailing of the doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the world, doth no waies ſhadow or obſcure, the demonſtrative force of this argument (to prove the royall deſcent of the Goſpel from Heaven) the great and marvellous ſucceſſe, wherein it reioyced over the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was the ſpreading and prevailing of the Goſpel upon the world, as it did, that occaſionally (partly through the weakneſſe, partly through the wickedneſſe of men,) promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that great prevailing of the religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the world. This it did occaſionally two waies: Firſt as it had acquainted the world with, and made familiar amongſt men, the knowledge (or at leaſt the diſcourſe) of all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:111412:163"/> in that religion which are any waies conſiderable, before the doctrine thereof did ſo much as look forth into the world. Secondly, As by reaſon of the neglect of it, and the unworthy walkings of men under it (now generally prevailing upon the world) God was provoked to give up the world, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate or injudicious minde; a judgement which made them capable of receiving the impreſſion of any doctrine or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whatſoever that ſhould be brought unto them, though never ſo erroneous or inconſiſtent with reaſon it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe; It is no waies like that the doctrine or law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould ever have bin ſo readily, or ſo generally received and ſubmitted unto as it was in the world, had not the Goſpel and the knowledge of the Scriptures, prepoſſeſſed the minds and apprehenſions of men, with many of the principall and moſt conſiderable things, (at leaſt with ſome kind of notions or broken ends of theſe things) which are propounded and taught in this law, as <hi>viz.</hi> concerning God as being the Creatour of heaven and earth, concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a great <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> a virgin; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immortality of the ſoule, the reſurrection of the dead, eternall pains or torments, immortall felicity and bliſſe, with ſeverall other ſuch things as theſe which are aſſerted in the ſaid law; The world having generally drunk in before hand; though not the ſteady or grounded belief, yet a kinde of generall and looſe credulity of ſuch things as theſe from the Goſpel, ſo that they were no waies new or ſtrange unto them, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> propounded them to be believed in his law, this muſt in reaſon needs be looked upon as a great advantage, yea as a preparation in the world to receive ſuch a doctrine or religion as that, which ſhould hold forth theſe things unto them, eſpecially in conjunction with other things, which were more ſutable to the vanity of their minds, and ſenſuality of their hearts, then other particularities of the Goſpel were; yea <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> judgment in the caſe is (which with me is very paſſeable,) that <hi>Mahometaniſme</hi> is nothing elſe but an hereſie; and the profeſſors of it, how many ſoever in number they be, a remnant of the <hi>Arrians</hi> of old, only more corrupt, and of a deeper degeneration from the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:111412:164"/> truth; (which is a thing of frequent obſervation in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation or ſucceſſion in the line of hereſie, the latter brood is commonly the worſt.) So then in this conſideration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo, the doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> had a ſpeciall advantage which the Goſpel had not, for the propagating and promoting of it in the world. When the Goſpel firſt ſet forth, and did that glorious execution, which hath been formerly repreſented unto you, upon the world, it had no ſuch foundations already laid to build it ſelf, and its acceptation in the world upon; all things (in a manner) which it propoſed unto men, were ſtrange and new, not ſo much as the name of Chriſt had been heard of in any of thoſe nations and kingdomes, which yet it ſubdued: the reſurrection of the dead by the confeſſion of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> themſelves, who were the wiſeſt and learnedſt men in the world, was a new and ſtrange doctrine unto them.<note place="margin">Act. 17. 1. 9</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is the ſame conſideration of other the main doctrines of the Goſpel, as of juſtification by faith, adoption, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſelf-deniall, &amp;c. the world had not ſo much as heard. by the lighteſt hearing of the eare of any of them, when the Goſpel came to demand beliefe of them, and ſubjection unto them. So that the religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> borrowed of the Goſpel (or rather ſtole from it,) a ſtock of truth formerly received and acknowledged by men, to ſet up with in the world, but the Goſpel ſet up without any advantage or help at all in this kind; it borrowed not any thing from the doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> (which had no being at all in the world in theſe daies) nor yet from any other Sect or kinde of learning, doctrine, or religion in the world whatſoever. That great eſtate of honour and acceptation, which it ſoon raiſed unto it ſelf in the world, it raiſed not by any contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution from other doctrines, but by means of that glorious ſpirit of light and truth which accompany it.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. by that time that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was now ready with his religion and law, to advance with them into the world, the world had in a very great meaſure withdrawn it ſelf from the Goſpel, I meane from that high eſteeme of it, which God expected men ſhould have had, and which the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:111412:164"/> infinite worth of the Goſpel it ſelf, in a way of reaſon and equity, required of them: yea they were generally grown rebellious againſt the laws and holy precepts and injunctions of it Upon which great provocation of Apoſtacy, the <hi>ſoule</hi> of the Almighty tooke not that pleaſure in the world, which it had done formerly. <hi>If any man draw back</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>my ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Now the world where the<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 38.</note> Goſpel had been formerly preached and received yea and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, in the holy laws thereof, about and before the times we ſpeak of (I mean of <hi>Mahomets</hi> coming upon the ſtage) had drawn back from the Goſpel, and were fallen from the love and conſcientious practiſe of it: and in this reſpect, <hi>the ſoul of the Lord tooke no pleaſure in it; i.</hi> (by the figure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is, when a little only is expreſſed, but much intended) <hi>the ſoul of the Lord</hi> greatly abhorred it, and reſolved to bring that great ſin, which it had committed in the contempt of the Goſpel, upon the head of it: Now the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the inflicting whereof God is wont (as it were) of courſe, to take vengeance upon men for the neglect, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Goſpel in the truth of it, is the giving of them up to deluſions to beleeve lies. This is evident from 2 Theſ. 2.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 11, 12.</note> 11, 12. <hi>And for this cauſe,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved. God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeve a lye, that they all might be damned who beleeved not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> And thus when the Jews rejected their true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> God avenged himſelfe upon them by that very judgment we ſpeak of; <hi>viz.</hi> by delivering them up to a ſpirit of that vanity and folly which prevailed with them to believe and follow counterfeit <hi>Meſſiahs,</hi> almoſt without end; yea even ſuch, who were ſo far from giving any ſuch ſubſtantiall and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative account of what they claimed and pretended unto, as he who was the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> indeed did, both by his doctrine, miracles and converſation; that they rather gave evident ſignes that they were indeed but counterfeits. Now then when <hi>Mahomet</hi> came to utter the baſe commodity of his lying religion in the world, he found the world in ſuch a poſture and condition to deale with him, and to believe him, wherein
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:111412:165"/> it had never been ſince the firſt day it was a world, untill then, <hi>viz.</hi> under the diſpleaſure of God for contempt of the Goſpel; a diſpleaſure of that nature and conſequence, that no other diſpleaſure of God (I meane for any other ſin or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation whatſoever) produceth the like ſtrange effects; in, or upon men, to make them preys to every lying vanity. Every ſpirit of deluſion that meets them in the world, under this judgment, may ſlay them, or doe with them whatſoever it liſteth. Yea there is little queſtion to be made, but that had this doctrine of <hi>Mahomet</hi> been ten degrees more rotten, or ridiculouſly irrationall then it is, it had at that time drawn the world after as it did. Now the Goſpel found not the world under any ſuch judgement, or diſpleaſure of God as this; no the day wherein the Goſpel went forth to viſit the world, was a day of love, and favour, and great compaſſion, from the moſt high God unto it; the world from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it (or however from the fall of man,) had not found the like grace or favour in his ſight, as now it had.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, The weapons, whereby the religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> was promoted in the world, were chiefly <hi>carnall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 8. 16.</note> and not <hi>spirituall;</hi> He taught the world his law, as <hi>Gideon taught the men of Succoth,</hi> I meane, <hi>with thorns and briers;</hi> and much after the ſame manner, wherein the <hi>Grand Scignior</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> procureth quarter for his religion and law in the world, whoſe chiefe quartermaſters were, <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>fagot.

            <p>A Third Demonſtration and proof (of that kinde we are now upon) that the Scriptures are from God, is the exact and punctuall fulfilling of thoſe predictions and prophecyes, which are contained in the Scriptures; as <hi>David</hi> in an holy addreſſe unto God concerning his providence and interpoſall about his conception, and firſt riſe of his being, expreſſeth himſelf thus; <hi>My ſubstance was not hid from thee, when I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth. Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in time were faſhioned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>when as yet there was none of them.</hi> In like manner it appears from the Scriptures, that whoever was the Authour of them, ſaw as it were, the ſubſtance and frame of many great events occurrences, changings, and turnings of things in the world, whilſt they were yet ſecret, and only in working in the loweſt parts of the Earth, and that he wrote down all the particulars of them in his book; which in time came to be faſhioned and to receive their being, whilſt as yet there was none of them. It would take up more time then you I believe would willingly allow for the perfecting of the demonſtration (and perhaps more then is neceſſary) to inſiſt particularly upon all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and predictions of future events that are found in the Scriptures and compare them with the events themſelves, and ſhew how particularly and punctually they have bin fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For certainly there is none of them, whoſe time and ſeaſon appointed for the fulfilling, is already paſt, that hath fallen to the ground, but they have all, from the greateſt to the leaſt of them, taken place and received actuall and compleat performance in all particulars whatſoever mentioned
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:111412:166"/> in the prediction, and are to this day numbred amongſt the famous providences of God, and hiſtoricall paſſages of the world. I ſhall inſiſt only upon ſome few of them, ſomewhat more particularly, pointing at others in a briefe and generall way; premiſing only theſe two things in two words. Firſt, That the predictions or prophecies of things in the Scriptures, (at leaſt many of them) are delivered in plaine ſignificant, and direct words, without ambiguities and doubtfullneſſe of ſenſe in the expreſſion; and ſecondly, that they are of ſuch events and things, whoſe effecting or coming to paſſe, in reſpect of ſecond cauſes, depended only upon thoſe that were meerly contingent, as (for the moſt part) upon the wills and actions of men, and not upon ſuch which act uniformly, and with neceſſity of cauſation: which kinde of events, may be foreſeen (at a good diſtance of time) by an eye of reaſon, enlightned only with the knowledge of natures courſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and workings. We ſhall have occaſion to touch upon theſe two particulars afterwards, but to our purpoſe: The Scriptures record ſeverall promiſes made unto <hi>Ahraham</hi> that great and famous Patriarch of the Jews, which were as ſo many prophecyes, or predictions of things that were future: we ſhall inſtance but two of theſe. amongſt many The one was concerning his having iſſue whenas yet he had none, nor was any waies like ever to have any, yea when he deſpared and was out of all hope of having any, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he unto God) <hi>thou haſt given me no ſeed, wherefore loe a ſervant of my houſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 3.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be mine beyre:</hi> Before he had the promiſe and word of God that he ſhould have iſſue, he did <hi>conſider his own body, as being now as good as dead,</hi> being almoſt 100, <hi>year old,</hi> and <hi>the deadneſſe of Sarahs womb too,</hi> and judged of things accordingly though (it's true) when once God had told him he ſhould have a childe by her, he conſidered neither (as the Apoſtle informeth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) But how unlikely ſoever it was in a way of reaſon, or experience that <hi>Abraham</hi> ever ſhould have a childe eſpecially by <hi>Sarah.</hi> yet the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall promiſe of God miſcarried not (no not in the leaſt) the womb of that was not dead, it brought forth that which was conceived in it, at the time appointed, <hi>for Sarah conceived</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:111412:166"/> (ſaith the text) <hi>and bare Abraham a ſon in his old age, at the ſame ſeaſon that God told him;</hi> Here was both ſubſtance and<note place="margin">Gen 21. 2.</note> circumſtance of what was foretold, performed. The other propheticall promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> was, concerning the going down of his poſterity into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the time of their ſervitude, and the manner of their deliverance from thence. This particular was foretold 400. <hi>years</hi> (at leaſt) before it was performed; and that at ſuch a time, when there was not the leaſt appearance or intimation of a likelyhood of it; <hi>Know of a ſurety</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham) that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them, and they ſhall afflict them 400. years: And alſo that nation whom they ſhall ſerve, will I judge, and afterwards they ſhall come out with great ſubſtance.</hi> Now how exactly this prediction was in all points<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 13, 14.</note> fulfilled, as well for the time propheſied of, as for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment executed upon the Egyptians, and deliverance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> poſterity, with that ſubſtance mentioned in the prophecy, is plainly and diſtinctly laid down in the book of <hi>Exodus;</hi> and beſides is not only avouched and conſtantly beleeved by the Jews themſelves at this day, who yet were bitter enemies to Chriſtianity, but is acknowledged by heathen writers themſelves and particularly by <hi>Porphyry</hi> (in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) who yet was one of the ableſt, and withall the moſt malicious enemie that Chriſtians ever had.</p>
            <p>Another famous propheſie, was that uttered by <hi>Jacob</hi> being now ready to leave the world; <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from betweene his feet until Shiloh come: and to him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</hi> This prophecy,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> as touching the fulfilling of it, <hi>i.</hi> the compleat fulfilling of it, was ſuſpended for well nigh 2000<hi rend="sup">d</hi> years; though it's true for a great part of this time <hi>viz.</hi> (as <hi>Josephus</hi> teſtifies) from the entrance of the government into the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the perſon of King <hi>David,</hi> untill the going out of it again in the perſon of <hi>Hircanus</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew; but when the time appointed was fulfilled, the propheſie it ſelf was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo; which was, when <hi>Herod</hi> a ſtranger, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation, cut of the houſe and line of <hi>Judah</hi> from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jury;</hi> about which time (as the New Teſtament it ſelf
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:111412:167"/> declareth) the <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſpoken of in the propheſie, <hi>i.</hi> the long expected <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (as all interpreters I have met with, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it) came. Now there are in and about this propheſie, ſome particulars of marvellous importance and weight for our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When this propheſie was uttered by <hi>Jacob,</hi> there was no likelihood at all that the nation of the Jews, <hi>i.</hi> the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Jacobs</hi> line, ſhould ever come to have any <hi>ſcepter</hi> or Kingly power amongſt them in any of their tribes whatſoever. For now the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were very low, and poore, and but few in number, in a ſtrange land; out of which they were never like to depart, or to become a diſtinct nation by themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſe ſuch a thing ſhould come to paſſe, I mean, that they ſhould fairly get out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and grow into a diſtinct people by themſelves, and come to have a ſcepter or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves; yet there was very little likelyhood, that ever this <hi>ſcepter</hi> ſhould come into <hi>Judahs</hi> hand; or the Government fall into his tribe; becauſe he had three elder brothers, <hi>Reuben, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who according to the law of nature, and cuſtome of all nations, were likely to enjoy the dignity before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When <hi>Moſes</hi> recorded and put in writing this propheſie (which was ſome hundreds of years after it was uttered) there was leſſe appearance or likelyhood of truth in it, then was at the time of the uttering it. For <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was now in actuall poſſeſſion of the Government, (who was of the tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi>) and was put into it by God himſelf: yea, and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> deſigned by God for his ſucceſſour, was not of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> And this conſideration (by the way) is a notable evidence for the truth and certainty of this, that the propheſie we ſpeake of, was uttered by <hi>Jacob;</hi> it being no waies like, that <hi>Moſes</hi> would ever have put ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in writing, to the diſparagement of his own tribe, or to the offence or provocation of the three tribes, <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> (two of which as hath been ſaid; were in priviledge of birth before <hi>Judah,</hi> and the third immediatly deſigned by God himſelfe to the government;) and perhaps of the reſt of the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:111412:167"/> tribes alſo, had it not been generally received amongſt them for a truth, that <hi>Jacob</hi> their father had ſpoken it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the daies of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was the laſt of the Judges, and about 400. years after <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was yet no appearance of any life or truth in this propheſie; in as much as the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not yet ſo much as look'd upon, or towards the tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> At laſt, when God, upon the importunity of the peoples deſire, granted them a King, he choſe <hi>Saul,</hi> who yet was not of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of <hi>Benjamin:</hi> and beſides, had ſeverall children, who were likely, one or other of them, they and their race, to have ſucceeded in, and inherited the kingdome. So that all this while the propheſie we ſpeak of, lay as if it had been quite dead, without breath or motion; as if there had been neither life nor ſoul in it. At laſt it began to open the eyes a little, when <hi>David,</hi> a poor young ſhepheard was choſen out of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to the King, and to ſtand as it were upon the feet, when the government and <hi>ſcepter</hi> were eſtabliſhed to him, and his poſterity. Yet,</p>
            <p n="5">5. We know that ten tribes of the twelve, at once revolted from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and never returned to their obedience again; but combined and conſpired with the Gentiles and enemies on every ſide, to overthrow and extirpate the ſaid Kingdome, and government of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Many of <hi>Davids</hi> race and poſterity themſelves, who ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Kingdome; ſinned againſt God with as high an hand (if not with a farre higher) then <hi>Saul</hi> had done, whom God rejected, with his poſterity, from the Kingdome. Yea,</p>
            <p n="7">7. The glorie and power of this Kingdom, was given by God into the enemies hand, and was made tributarie to other States and Kingdomes, for many years together; as firſt to the <hi>Caldeans</hi> or <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet,</p>
            <p n="8">8. And laſtly, the ſpirit of Truth in this Propheſie wrought through all theſe difficulties and improbabilities, brake in ſunder all theſe barrs of iron, and firſt brought the ſcepter and government into, and then maintained and kept it in the hand of <hi>Iudah,</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> or <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was ready to <hi>come:</hi> or (which is the ſame) till <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is called Chriſt, was now
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:111412:168"/> ready to be born into the world. Evident it is from <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> and other grave Hiſtorians of thoſe times, that it was a very little while before the birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> made that bloody maſſacre of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (ſo much ſpoken of) and ſlew <hi>Hircanus</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Davids</hi> race.</p>
            <p>A third very remarkable Propheſie recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is that concerning <hi>Cyrus;</hi> which was given out by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> above an 100. (ſome ſay, near 200.) years before <hi>Cyrus</hi> was born. You have it in the latter end of the 44. and beginning of the 45. chapters of this Prophet: <hi>That ſaith of Cyrus</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Iſa 44. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p n="1">1. That a man ſhould be call'd by his name an 100. years and more before he was born (it is like, long before his Parents were born, who were at liberty to call him by any other name.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it ſhould at ſuch a diſtance of time be ſaid (and that with truth, as the event famouſly known, declared) that ſuch a man ſhould conquer ſo great and potent a monarchy, as that of <hi>Babylon</hi> was at this time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſhould build again the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which others of his own religion had deſtroyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he ſhould doe it indeed, accordingly; theſe things (I mean, predictions and events compared together) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are the undoubted characters of him, who with one view overlooketh the long tract and whole duration of time which extendeth it ſelf from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof, with all the motions, occurrences, and events, of things that riſe up, and fall, and come to paſſe within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Nor can this prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> be any waies ſuſpected of forgery, or ſuppoſititiouſneſſe in any kinde; in as much as it was pronounced openly, as other propheſies were, in the hearing of all the people, and ſo divulged into many hands before the captivity: and then alſo carried into <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Chaldea;</hi> where it is no otherwaies like, but that it was diſperſed, ſeen, and read of many, many years before the accompliſhment of it, yea whilſt as yet it look'd like a <hi>cloud without water,</hi> or a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:111412:168"/> parcell of words, that neither had weight, nor worth of truth in them.</p>
            <p>And for the event of the thing as 1. That there was ſuch a man as <hi>Cyrus;</hi> 2. That a man called by this name did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Babylon,</hi> and veſted himſelf with the Monarchy thereof; and 3. That the ſame man did reſtore the captivity of the Jews, and furthered the building of the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with large contributions of his own money thereunto, heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours themſelves, and generally they that write the hiſtories of thoſe times, do atteſt and confirm.</p>
            <p>To paſſe by many other particular prophecyes, in other parts of the Scriptures, how many are there in <hi>Daniel</hi> alone, very ſtrange and wonderfull (compared with the nature, and truth of their correſpondent events) as, 1. That concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> foretold unto him in the midſt of his great jollity,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 25, 26, &amp;c. Dna. 11. 1, 2.</note> and triumph, and in the hearing of all his nobles. 2. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> in the beginning of the ſecond <hi>monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which foretold him, how many Kings ſhould reigne after him; and how the fourth, who was to be the laſt, and <hi>Darius</hi> by name too, ſhould fight againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and be overcome by à <hi>Grecian King</hi> (which was <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.) and 3. That alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kingdome of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as that, after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, it ſhould be divided, and torn in pieces by his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and not paſſe to his poſterity (which laſt is confirmed<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 3, 4.</note> by many heathen writers.) 4. That great prophecy, concerning the four great Monarchies of the world, which are ſo lively and diſtinctly deſcribed, as if he had lived in them all, and had had that experience of them all reſpectively, which the world ſince hath had. 5. That concerning the fight between <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> under the names of, the <hi>fierce Goat</hi> with one horn, and the <hi>great Ram.</hi> But to paſſe by theſe, with divers others of like conſideration, in the writings of this one Prophet; yea and a 1000<hi rend="sup">d</hi> more in other parts of the Scriptures; I ſhall only further inſiſt upon ſome few particulars of thoſe many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, which are found in the Old Teſtament concerning Chriſt; and particularly upon thoſe which relate to ſuch things about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that are recorded and acknowledged by thoſe,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:111412:169"/> who are no friends, or favourers of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a great concurrence of Scripture prediction in the old Teſtament, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was to be God. We<note place="margin">Iſa. 7. 14. Jer 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Jer. 33. 16, &amp;c.</note> ſhall not need to inſtance for the proof hereof, the Scriptures being (generally) ſo well known to us in this behalf. The ancient Jews, and particularly the holy <hi>Rabbine</hi> (as the Jews call him)<note place="margin">Rabbi Hacca doſch.</note> who lived not long after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were cleerly of this faith. The expreſſions of ſome of them to this point, are marvellouſly remarkable; but it would be too much to burthen you with the particular records of them. <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> the moſt learned of this nation ſince the Prophets, and who lived in the ſame time with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having mentioned a tradition amongſt them, which ſaith, that before their return from baniſhment, they <hi>muſt expect the death of an High Prieſt;</hi> profeſſeth this to be his opinion concerning this <hi>High Prieſt, viz.</hi> that <hi>he ſhall be the very word of God, which ſhall be void of all ſin, voluntary, and involuntary, whoſe Father ſhall be God; and this word ſhall be that fathers wiſdome, by which all things in the world were created.</hi> The <hi>Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

One of theſe <hi>Propheteſſes</hi> begins her Greek meeter thus: <hi>Know thy God which is the Son of God;</hi> And <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> a learned Jew and Hiſtorian, who was born a very ſhort time after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though he doth not expreſly acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been, God, yet he ſeems ſomewhat tender of calling him a man, <hi>i.</hi> a meer man. The tenour of his words, as to this purpoſe, is well known: <hi>There was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at this time one Jeſus, a wiſe man, <hi>if it be lawfull to call him a man;</hi> a worker of moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull</hi>

               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:111412:169"/>2. The Scripture Prophecy which went before of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah Chriſt,</hi> predeclared likewiſe unto the world, that he was<note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6. Pſa. 27. 12. &amp;c.</note> to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The tenour of this propheſie alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, is atteſted both by Jews, and Gentiles. For the former: The ancient Jewiſh Expoſitions more generally (and ſome of the later alſo) both hold, and prove by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was, and is to be the very Son of God. Multiplicity of quotations in this kinde, would but overcharge the diſcourſe. Take the firſt fruits in ſtead of the harveſt. <hi>Rabbi Kimhi</hi> proveth by a long diſcourſe, that the word, <hi>Shiloh</hi> (in <hi>Jacobs</hi> propheſie concerning <hi>Christ Gen.</hi> 49. 10. formerly mentioned) ſignifieth as much as, <hi>Filius ejus,</hi> his <hi>Son;</hi> that is, the Son of God.

The truth is, that the body of the Scriptures is enlivened with the ſpirit of prophecy (allmoſt) throughout: and if we were capable of, or narrowly intent upon ſuch obſervations, we might (I conceive) be able upon ſufficient ground to ſay,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:111412:171"/> that there is ſcarce any day paſſeth over our heads, wherein ſome remarkeable prediction, or other, contained in the Scriptures, doth not bring forth, and is delivered of ſome Truth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and concernment unto the world.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:111412:173"/> and courſe of life have looked quite another way. Yea morall Philoſophers and wiſe ſtatiſts, who are well ſtudied in the actions, manners, diſpoſitions and tempers of men, and have converſed (in hiſtory) with the moſt underſtanding and knowing perſons of all ages, and of all countries and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, about all the memorable occurrences, changes, and of affairs, that took place in their reſpective generations, together with the ſpecialties of occaſions and means producing them; may poſſibly, from a prudentiall contemplation partly of the preſent juncture of things in a ſtate or Common-wealth, partly of the inclinations, and humours, moſt predominant in the generalitie of the people, foreſee, in a way of pregnant conjecture, and ſuch as ſeldome miſcarrieth, what will befall this State or Common-wealth; either to the advancement, or to the detriment of it, within ſuch, or ſuch a time. But to predeclare particularities of events, whilſt there is yet nothing at all in being, any waies likely to produce them, or to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards their being, yea ſuch events, which depend upon the meere motions, and acts of the wills of particular perſons yet unborn, and to the effecting whereof, when they are born, they cannot be led, neither by any common principle or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of reaſon, nor yet by any evill inclination, or corrupt principle incident to the natures of men; to predeclare (I ſay) and give perfect and diſtinct knowledge unto the world, of ſuch events of theſe long before their coming to paſſe, is an undoubted and indiſputable character of <hi>one greater then Solomon</hi> in wiſdome; even of him, who was able to read the long roll of time from the one end of it unto the other; whileſt it was yet folded up; and whoſe knowledge prevented all, and all manner of beings whatſoever, but his own. Now this kind of prediction being frequently found in the Scriptures, and accordingly juſtified by a conſtant correſpondency of event (both which have been ſealed for truths in the former part of this Demonſtration) doth it not make it plain <hi>robbery</hi> either for men, or Angels, to count or claime themſelves the Authours of them?</p>

But doubtleſſe great and marvellous are the works, and effects, which the Goſpel (or if you will, which God by the Goſpel) hath both heretofore wrought, yea and ſtill continueth working from day to day in the world; you have heard how gloriouſly it hath triumphed, over the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this world, with all the power thereof; the old, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and rooted ſuperſtitions and idolatries, the wickedneſſes and impieties, the prophaneſſe, Atheiſme, and unbelief, which ruled and raged with an high hand, in all places of the world amongſt the ſons and daughters of men; yea how it hath mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified it ſelf in the hearts and conſciences of men and women, againſt the faces and frowns of <hi>the terrible ones;</hi> againſt the moſt cruell and bloudy edicts of Emperours, Kings, and States, yea, and againſt the moſt furious executions of them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall (for the preſent) inſiſt only upon three things, to give authority and ſtrength to the Demonſtration in hand.

            <p>Firſt, The great and marvellous works, which the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 5.</note> or God by the Goſpel, performes, and produceth from day to day in the world, are theſe (with their fellows) Firſt the ſubduing of the hearts, and mindes, and conſciences of men, to a ſetled perſwaſion and beliefe of the Truth of ſupernaturall things: of things which are very remote from the common thoughts and apprehenſions of men, and which are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be beleeved; (the beleeving whereof the Scripture calls, <hi>obedience unto the Faith</hi>) as for example; that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be both God and man in one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he ſhould be born of a virgin, that he ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die, eſpecially upon thoſe terms of ſhame and torment, for the benefit of others. That he ſhould riſe againe from the dead the third day; that believing theſe things concerning him, ſhould be a means of the juſtifying of a ſinfull man, in the ſight of God, and ſo of bringing him into an eſtate of immortall bleſſedneſſe and glory (with ſome others of like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the Goſpel (I ſay) fights againſt the naturall unbeliefe of theſe things in the hearts and judgments of men, and breakes the ſtifneſſe and ſtubborneſſe of their diffidence, into a rationall, free, and willing conſent unto the truth of them. Many who deſpiſed and rejected the great things of the Goſpel, formerly, as things deviſed by men; now imbrace them as the oracles of God. The Goſpel anoints mens eyes with ſuch a precious and ſoveraigne <hi>eye-ſalve,</hi> that it makes them able to ſee cleerneſſe of truth in thoſe things, wherein they ſaw nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and doubtfullneſſe (yea falſhood and untruth to their apprehenſions.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another work of the Goſpel great and marvellous alſo (as we ſhall ſhew preſently) is, the taking off of mens hearts from the world; the cooling and quenching of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate heat, wherewith men naturally, and according to the courſe of the world in every place, are wont to burn in deſires after the things of the earth, and the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the outward man. When the heart of a man and the world are ſo cloſe knit and incorporated, as it were, together, that they are become one fleſh (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the adulterer, and adultereſſe, in reference to the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:111412:174"/> act of their wickedneſſe) the Goſpel many times comes and gets in betweene, divides, and ſeparates the one from the other, throws the one one way, as it were towards the Eaſt, and the other, another way, towards the Weſt: and ſo keeps them aſunder for ever. It falls upon the heart and ſoule like lightning, and melts down the great mountaine of the world there, and makes it become a plain. It diſſolves the ſorceryes and inchantments, wherewith the world is wont to bewitch the mindes and affections of men, and to binde the facultyes and powers of the ſoule, ſo that theſe ſhall act nothing to the recovery of them from this miſerable bondage. The ſpirit which is in the Goſpel being <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>stronger, then he that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19 8.</note> 
               <hi>is in the world, takes away his weapons from him,</hi> and binds him, and then <hi>divideth his spoiles.</hi> This kinde of work, it wrought upon <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when it ſo far looſed thoſe iron chains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his ſoule had of a long time been faſt bound to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, that at once he gave away unto the poore, <hi>the one halfe of his Kingdome;</hi> I mean, of thoſe <hi>goods,</hi> which he had been long in getting and gathering together; yea and further offered and ingaged himſelf to make a foure-fold reſtitution, of whatſoever he had unjuſtly wrung from any man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another great work of the Goſpel is, it makes men ſelf-deniers. Men naturally are deniers of other men, yea and of God and Chriſt; but great confeſſours and zealous aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of themſelves: they ſtand naturally ſo deeply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted and affected to themſelves, and the promoting of their own good (as they call good) that in the proſecution and purſuance hereof, they take little, or no notice of, but tread and trample upon, the due intereſts and rights, both of God and men; as if they were dead, or not in being, and ſo had no right to any thing, and as if themſelves were only alive. This I mean, by denying God, and other men, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing or aſſerting themſelves. But now the Goſpel, when that comes upon men in the power of it, it batters in peeces, and grinds to powder this principle and inclination in them; and makes them denyers of themſelves, and confeſſours or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgers of God and men, yea of all men: it makes them able and willing, to neglect and trample upon their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:111412:175"/> ends, and deſires, when they cannot be promoted and carried on, with the preſervation of all the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges both of God and men. It teacheth men to ſeeke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own good, not in oppoſition to (which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they are inclin'd unto) but only in conjunction with the glory of God, and good of all men. By the tenour of which practiſe and courſe, they looſe, or hide themſelves as it were in the croud, and drown their own intereſts in the intereſts and good of many. This operation of the Goſpel was cleerly ſeen upon <hi>Paul. Even as I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pleaſe all men for their</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 33.</note> 
               <hi>good, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved.</hi> When he ſaith, <hi>not ſeeking mine own profit,</hi> he doth not mean or imply, that he did not pleaſe himſelf, or <hi>ſeek his own profit, ſimply,</hi> or not at all; but he <hi>ſought not his own profit</hi> by it ſelf, or apart from, or out of the way of the <hi>profit,</hi> that great <hi>profit</hi> of other mens ſalvation. For certainly <hi>Paul pleaſed himſelf,</hi> to the higheſt degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of pleaſure and contentment that he knew how to doe, in pleaſing all men, and ſeeking the <hi>profit</hi> of all men; and had an eye to his own benefit and <hi>profit,</hi> as well as to the profit of all men: as he expreſſeth himſelf elſewhere: <hi>And this I doe</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of that very courſe of his we ſpeake of, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>pleaſing all men,</hi> or <hi>ſeeking</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>the profit of all men,) And this I doe for the Gospel ſake, that I may be partaker thereof with you; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Paul</hi> had a deſire to partake himſelf of the benefit and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Goſpel; as well as that other men ſhould partake of them. But this was his glory and crown, that he did not deſire to partake of them alone, but in conjunction with other men; yea his deſire to partake of the Goſpel upon theſe terms (I mean with company, and in conjunction with others) was ſo ſtrong &amp; potent in him, that he made orts (as we uſe to ſay) of all his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour intereſts, and contentments, in the world, and which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his outward man, for the promoting and obtaining of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another great work of the Goſpel, is the changing of mens hearts and diſpoſitions; the turning as it were, the courſe and frame of nature upſide-down within them: the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of thoſe and ſuch like propheſies in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (in a ſpirituall ſenſe) where he ſaith that <hi>in the wilderneſſe, waters

               </hi> And again, <hi>I will plant in the wilderneſſe the Cedar, the Shittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 55 13.</note> 
               <hi>the myrtle tree</hi> &amp;c. Such a kind of change as theſe, doth the Goſpel make in the natures, and ſpirits, and hearts of men, When it firſt comes unto them, it findes them like ſo many wilderneſſes and deſerts, full of thorns and briers, but no fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, uſefull, or pleaſant tree growing in them; full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, luſts, vile affections, corruptions, and inclinations unto evill, as covetouſneſſe, uncleanneſſe, pride, deceit, cruelty. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but no holy or righteous affection at all; but the Goſpel comes, and makes <hi>waters to breake out in theſe deſerts, makes the firre-tree and the myrtle-tree to grow in ſtead of thorns and briers, i.</hi> it poures the grace of God, and ſheds the influences of heaven upon the ſoules of men; by means whereof in ſtead of thoſe diſtempers, and baſe affections, of pride, covetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, uncleaneſſe <hi>&amp;c,</hi> there ſpring up holy affections and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſpoſitions, as of love, meekneſſe, purity, chaſtity, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe take place in men, and fill the ſoule. This effect of the Goſpel, was very viſible in the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> as the Apoſtle deſcribes their different eſtates or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, before, and after, the Goſpel had to do with them. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> viz. <hi>fornicatours, idolatours, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Another effect of the Goſpel, great and wonderfull alſo, is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> notably deſcribes and ſets out, 2. <hi>Cor. 10. viz. the pulling down of strong holds, and caſting down of imaginations, and every high thing which exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every</hi>

Now the Goſpel notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding comes, and encounters, and fights againſt theſe ſtrong holds, theſe high imagnations in men; and attempts the battery and the ſhaking of them, firſt, on the one ſide, then on the other, diſcovering and evincing to the judgements and conſciences of men, that there is vanity, and extreame danger in them, in this reſpect, and in that, and in a third, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in many more: and by this time they begin to ſhake and bow, and ſtand more looſely, and weakly in the judgements and mindes of men, and with much more neerneſſe to a reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But by that time the Goſpel and the wiſdome thereof, have made a cleer repreſentation of their own principles, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to them, and have argued theſe throughly, and have left no objection or thought againſt them in the mindes of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered,

But as the Goſpel and the ſpirit that works in it, <hi>caſt down that imagination</hi> we ſpake of in <hi>Paul,</hi> and made it an abhomination and abhorring to his ſoule, yea and planted another directly oppoſite unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> this, that <hi>he ought to do many things,</hi> yea all he could, for <hi>the name of this Jeſus:</hi> ſo may there a day of ſuch a gracious viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dawn upon the men we ſpeak of, from God, wherein the Goſpel ſhall <hi>throw down</hi> with an high hand, that dark and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>imagination,</hi> by the ducture and guidance whereof, their hearts and their handes are lifted up together (and that to a ſtrange height) to reach the moleſtation of the Saints, and the ruines of their liberties; and in ſtead thereof, put another principle into them which will lead them a contrary courſe, and enlarge them mightily to <hi>build up</hi> the liberties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which now they deſtroy.

            <p n="6">6. A Sixth is; the abaſing of the proud, the caſting of ſecure, careleſſe, fearleſſe and prophane men into the <hi>den of Lions,</hi> into the midſt of the raging, terrifying, and devouring fears, and expectations of hell fire. It is an expreſſion of God himſelf unto <hi>Job: Caſt abroad the rage of thy wrath, and behold every one that is proud, and abaſe him: Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their places, hide them in the duſt together, and binde their</hi>

Laſtly, Another great effect and work of the Goſpel is; it lifts men up unto heaven, and that ſometimes out of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt hell: it reſcues the ſouls and ſpirits of men out of the hand of violent fears, and the moſt devouring and raging ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: it makes <hi>the bones,</hi> which ſin <hi>had broken, to rejoyce,</hi> and the faces of many to ſhine <hi>like the face of an Angel,</hi> which before had <hi>gathered</hi> the <hi>blackneſſe</hi> of hell.

            <p>Conſider we now (in a word) the nature and import of theſe great effects, that we may ſee and underſtand, whether they do not teach, and that with authority and power, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures parentage and deſcent from God. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great works and miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought, came<note place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:111412:178"/> we may come, nay, we cannot lightly but come, to a ſtable and grounded certainty and belief in our ſelves, that doubtleſſe they alſo are from God, For (certainly) no learning, wiſedom, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>could doe</hi> ſuch things, <hi>except God were with them.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, How great a thing it is, that the judgements and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, ſhould be ſubdued under ſuch myſterious, and ſupernaturall Truths, ſo farre remote from the thoughts and apprehenſions of men, as many of thoſe are, which are held forth by the Goſpel; yea as thoſe are, which are the ſpirit and life, the heart and ſoul thereof? As that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> one reputed a Carpenters ſon in the world, neglected, yea, hated by the great, the wiſe, and prudent ones of his generation, deſpiſed, ſcorn'd, ignominiouſly uſed, put to death as a malefactor and evil doer, ſhould, all theſe notwithſtanding, be the Son of God; that he ſhould be born of a virgin, that he ſhould riſe again from the dead, that by dying he ſhould purchaſe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perfect remiſſion of ſins, but an everlaſting eſtate in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and in glory, for all thoſe that ſhould beleeve in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that men (I ſay) ſhould be carried over ſuch a great gulf of fears and doubtings, of objections, of unlikelihoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the boſome of ſuch Truths; eſpecially that this ſhould be done with ſo much frequency, and in ſo many inſtances, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe, that have been, and are ſtill from day to day thus carried over, argues the preſence and ingagement of a mighty ſpirit indeed, in, and about thoſe truths. How much more, if we ſhall further add, that the believing of theſe things by men, is mightily oppoſed, not only with objections and difficulties, which very ſeemingly, and with the appearance of a ſtrong hand, riſe up againſt the truth of them, but by worldly intereſts alſo without end, as eaſe, credit, pleaſures, eſtates, friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are mighty diſſwaſives unto men, from ſo much as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall ſearching after them, and the truth of them; and this in two reſpects; Firſt, as the very time and labour of mind which a man muſt beſtow, and undergoe in ſuch a ſearch after them, is contrary to mens eaſe, and pleaſures, and otherwiſe like to ſtreighten them, in many worldly occaſions. Secondly, as a mans being obſerved and taken notice of, for being ſtudious and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly engaged in that kind, is like to bring trouble upon his head,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:111412:178"/> and moleſtation from the world, to gain him the loſſe of friends, credit, eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as much, as if he did ſeriouſly and fully beleeve, what in this caſe he is but inquiring after.</p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, If we ſhall conſider thoſe other effects of the Goſpel that were mentioned, as, the taking off of mens hearts from the world, the making of men deniers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the changing of mens tempers and diſpoſitions, <hi>the caſting down of</hi> their <hi>imaginations, and bringing every thought in</hi> them <hi>into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. theſe, even every one of them, from the greateſt to the leaſt, and much more all of them put together, and laid in conſideration with the frequency of their production in men, is as cleer an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and confirmation, that thoſe Scriptures, that wiſdom, that doctrine, by which they are wrought, are from God, as the ſight of the ſun being riſen, is an evidence that the night and the darkneſſe thereof, are paſt. The glory of ſuch works as theſe, is as the glory of the word of God. The ſpirituall and moſt intimous nature and property of them, ſheweth, that means or cauſe, by which they are produced, to be full of his ſpirit, who is as intimate and inward with men, as themſelves, or their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>All the wiſdom, and writings, and learning that ever was in the world beſides, cannot ſhew ſo much as the appearance, or face of ſuch a generation of proſelytes, or children, as the Goſpel can; and not ſo much as one perſon of like noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and inward parts with thouſands of thoſe, who are the genuine and right-born offspring hereof. The talleſt and beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown men, that ever ſprang from the root of <hi>Plato, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> or any other of thoſe ancient Fathers of ſecular learning, were but a race of dwarfes, or pygmies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worth, and true excellencie of ſpirit, being compared with a great part of that heroique progeny, whoſe hearts and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits came by the way of a ſecond birth, out of the loins and bowels of the Goſpel. Yea the whole fraternity of this parentage, breaths part and fellowſhip in the Divine nature it ſelf.</p>
            <p>A fifth demonſtration (of that houſe we are now ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) which reacheth, and takes faſt hold of the ſame concluſion
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:111412:179"/> with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures and the Goſpel, are from God, is the conſideration of the tenour or manner of the government of the world, and of the workings of the hearts and ſpirits of men of all kindes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it. That exact conformity and agreement, which both the one and the other hold with the deſcriptions, reports and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of things in the Scriptures, and in the Goſpel, doth cleerly demonſtrate and evince theſe to be from God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the government of the world: How are all things carried, ordered, and managed herein, as well in a permiſſive, as in an active or executive way, according to the model and plat forme of the Scriptures?</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the permiſſive part of this Government, how are things permitted and ſuffered to come to paſſe, and to take place in the world, with all poſſible exactneſſe according to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Scriptures in that behalf? This we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der chiefly in theſe foure particulars: Firſt in the frequent infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miſcarriages of the Saints. Secondly, in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Saints from the men of this world. Thirdly, in the relapſes and declinations of great multitudes of forward, and ſometimes ſeemingly zealous profeſſours, into ways of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome of worldlineſſe, ſome of pleaſures, yea ſome into ways of perſecution it ſelf. Fourthly (and laſtly) in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt periſhing of the generality, or farre greateſt part of men, through the luſts of the fleſh, ignorance, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We know, and too too frequent experience informeth us, that the Saints, and good men, are oft left unto themſelves, to the weakneſſe of their hearts, and vanity of their mindes: in which caſes they are like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when his hair was cut, who was then <hi>but like other men;</hi> and quitted himſelf with no more ſtrength or courage againſt his enemies, then ordinary men did; and was taken priſoner by the <hi>Philiſtim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Even ſo many times it is with the Saints and ſervants of God themſelves; they are overcome with temptations, and faulter and ſtumble, and do unworthily, after the manner of the world round about them, and not like unto themſelves: they ſtep out of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:111412:179"/> the ways of grace, into the ways of the pride, the covetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the unjuſtice, the uncleaneſſe, the raſhneſſe and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſſe, the fearfullneſſe and baſeneſſe of the world. Now ſuch permiſſions as theſe on Gods part, anſwer exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe permiſſive diſpenſations of his, which are held forth in many places of the Scriptures. <hi>Abraham</hi> that great beleever, and <hi>Father</hi> of beleevers, was left unto himſelf; and then how did he faulter about <hi>Sarah?</hi> And ſo <hi>Sarah,</hi> when ſhe denied that ſhe laughed, ſo likewiſe <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> how did God leave them in the hand of a bloudy and revengfull paſſion: and how treacherouſly and cruelly did they deale with the poore men of <hi>Sichem?</hi> And ſo how were both they, and the reſt of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> their brethren, tranſported with a paſſion of envy againſt their younger Brother <hi>Joſeph?</hi> even as many now (we hope Brethren in the faith; as they were both in the faith, and in the fleſh too, unto <hi>Joſeph</hi>) through envy, that God ſhould give better and richer viſions of himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lf unto theire younger Brethren (as they look upon them) then unto them, are ready to ſell them into the hands of the <hi>Iſhmalites,</hi> I mean to expoſe them to the rage and fury of the rude multitude. But this by the way, We might inſtance in many other of the Saints of God in this kinde, as in <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Joſhua, David, Solomon, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. who though they were Saints, yet being left by God to themſelves, they did like ſinners. This permiſſive providence of God (as hath been ſaid) mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth it ſelf in the world, among the Saints in every place at this day: The greateſt enemies the Scriptures have, will be free enough to give teſtimony unto them in this behalfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God ſometimes leaves his Saints in the hand of their ſpirituall enemies, tentations, and they do with them (in their kinde) <hi>even what they list;</hi> ſo otherwhile doth he leave them alſo in the hand of their outward, their bodily enemies, evil men, and they doe unto them ſometimes even what they liſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (in their way,) they injure them, they oppreſſe them, they cruſh them, tread and trample them under their feet, as if there were none that look'd after them, or took any care what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of them. Our Saviours expreſſion is concerning <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:111412:180"/> 
               <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that <hi>they did unto him, even what they liſted;</hi> implying,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 12.</note> that as Holy, and High in intereſt with God as <hi>Iohn</hi> was, yet did not God (as might in reaſon have been expected he would have done, conſidering how great a man <hi>Iohn</hi> was in his ſight) interpoſe in the leaſt, to hinder that ſhameleſſe danghter of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial (Herodias</hi> I mean) from having her revengfull will upon him by his death.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner, we ſee and heare daily, things acted and done in the midſt of us; many holy and faithfull men, are miſuſed and dealt with, according to the will and luſts of men that know not God,; they are ſuffered to goe as farre in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing them, as their hearts deſire: and there is none that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them. They revile them, they beat them, they oppreſſe them they ſpoil their ſubſtance, they impriſon them, they bring them before their judgment ſeats, and obtain cruell ſentences againſt them. Yea its more then to be feared, that there will be a more generall leaving of the Saints, to the luſts of their <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>

Yea it appears from ſeverall places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any appearance of God on the behalfe of his people in the times of this perſecution, will be ſo rare, that they will generally be at the point, at which they, who were in the ſhip with <hi>Paul,</hi> in that dangerous voyage at ſea, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. were, whenas ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The expreſſion ſeems to point at ſuch a time of univerſall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger upon the Churches of Chriſt, wherein they ſhall all ſeeme to lie <hi>covered</hi> all over <hi>with the ſhadow of death;</hi> So that deliverance ſhall be thought as incredible a thing to them, as that plenty <hi>in the gates of Samaria,</hi> which <hi>Eliſha</hi> prophecyed, in the time of an extream famine, was to the noble man <hi>on whoſe hand the King of Iſrael leaned.</hi> 2 Kings. 7. 3.</p>

            <p>And as he is not like to finde faith amongſt his friends his Saints, ſo neither is he like to finde feare in his enemies, upon the ſame ground, though his coming will bring both faith in abundance unto the one, and feare in abundance upon the other.

            <p>Firſt, For things naturall, about which the working provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God we ſpeake of, is held forth, and repreſented unto us in the Scriptures, they are of two ſorts: either firſt, ſuch as are meerly naturall; or ſecondly, ſuch, which though they be in part, and in a ſenſe, naturall, yet they are in a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our conſideration, <hi>judiciall</hi> alſo (for we want a better term for our purpoſe) For the firſt of theſe, things meerly naturall, we know the Scriptures, even from the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the firſt penman of them, gave knowledge as from the mouth of God himſelf, that there ſhould be ſeed-time and<note place="margin">Gen. 822.</note> harveſt, <hi>and cold and heat, and ſummer and winter; and that day and night ſhould not ceaſe.</hi>

               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:111412:182"/> (as ſome uſe to diſtinguiſh) but <hi>de generibus ſingulorum:</hi> his meaning is not that <hi>all things come alike</hi> to all individuall and particular perſons; but to all, and every kind of perſons, in reſpect of ſome particulars in every kinde (as was ſaid.) How doe we ſee the contents of theſe lines viſibly acted, and put in execution from day to day in the world? If you ſee a righteous and holy man, one, or more, rejoycing in one place, if you will look but a little about you, you ſhall ſee a wicked and prophane man rejoycing in another.</p>
            <p>And again if you ſee a wicked man, mourning or afflicted in one place, you may ſoone ſee a godly man in the ſame poſture and condition of ſorrow, in another; yea if we conſider the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular providences of God in outward things, which are the cauſes, either of the rejoycing, or of the heavineſſe, whether of the one ſort of men, or other; we ſhall finde a likeneſſe, or ſameneſſe in theſe alſo betweene them. Doe godly men proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and thrive through the bleſſing of God, in the way of their callings, and gather ſubſtance? you may finde ungodly men, that proſper and thrive as faſt as they. Do ungodly men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and ſink in their outward eſtates, fall from riches to poverty in the world? we know that this is the portion of many godly men alſo. Have godly men any cauſe of comfort and joy in their relations, as in wives, children, ſervants, when theſe anſwer the deſire of their ſoules? you may finde men who know not God, that will match them in all theſe. So again, if you know wicked men that are of infirme and unhealthfull bodies, ſubject to troubleſome diſtempers, or painfull deſeaſes, as the gout, ſtone, or the like: you may finde in the generation of the righteous, thoſe that bear them company in theſe alſo. Yea and on the contrary, healthfullneſſe, and ſtrength, and activeneſſe of body, is a providentiall commodity or bleſſing, wherein many of the one ſort, and of the other, are partners. And (to inſtance only once more in this kinde,) is there any ſtrange hand of God, ſore and terrible, ſometimes laid upon wicked men, in any extraordinary judgment, as in any ſuddain or untimely death (as we call it) very grievous (it may be) for the manner of it; either upon themſelves, their children, or the like? you may finde examples of like providences
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:111412:182"/> falling even amongſt the tents of the righteous alſo. Under this head may well be reduced that kinde of diſpenſation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which the Scripture expreſſeth, verſ. 11. of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Chapter. <hi>I returned and ſaw vnder the ſun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the strong, neither yet</hi>

               <hi>bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill.</hi> The meaning is not as if <hi>the race were</hi> never <hi>to the ſwift,</hi> or <hi>the battell</hi> never <hi>to the ſtrong</hi> &amp;c. no nor yet as if the <hi>race were</hi> not more ordinarily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>unto the ſwift;</hi> and <hi>the battel,</hi> uſually <hi>to the ſtrong; but</hi> only to ſhew that <hi>time and chance</hi> (as it followeth) <hi>happneth to them all. i.</hi> that God reſerveth a liberty unto himſelf to interpoſe when he pleaſeth, and to umpire matters of event and ſucceſſe, contrary to the Law, and common rule of ſecond cauſes; with which notwithſtanding he ordinarily concurreth, and ſo makes it altogether uncertain unto men, when he intendeth a variation or digreſſion. And this kinde of digreſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (as we may call it) ſometimes ruleth in the affaires and concernments of men that are ſtrangers unto God, as well as it doth at other times, in matters relating unto his Saints. And thus you ſee, how the providence of God in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> in an indifferent diſpenſing of outward mercies and judgments to ſome of either ſort of men, godly and ungodly, acteth and worketh in the world, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible exactneſſe, according to the model preſented unto us in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, conſider we how the ſame Providence acteth alſo in the world according to the expreſſe tenour of the Scriptures in a way of judgement, with the ſame relation, not to ſome particulars only of either ſort of men (as was ſhewd in the former branch) but to all of both ſorts (at leaſt in ſome degree to all of both ſorts) who live together (as it were) within the ſphere of the activitie, of each particular<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 7.</note> judgment. Our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. foreſheweth, that before <hi>the end comes</hi> (as he ſpeaketh). <hi>i.</hi> before the great day of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the world for the judgment of it, <hi>Nation, ſhall riſe against Nation, and Kingdom, againſt Kingdom; and that there ſhall be famins, and peſtilences, and earth-quakes in divers
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:111412:183"/> places.</hi> We our ſelves experimentally know that ſuch things as theſe have been executed, and come to paſſe in the world ſome of them in our daies, and in thoſe parts of the world, where we have become. They that are verſed in Hiſtories, have the knowledge of many more particulars in this kinde. And how little difference ſuch judgments as theſe have put between godly men and others, within the line of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective fallings, and prevailings, I appeal to the teſtimonies of all thoſe, who have been obſervers of ſuch things, and moſt narrowly watched the particular windings, and turnings, the leapings over, and the lightings on, the particular favours, and ſeverities of Providence under ſuch judgments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly (and laſtly to this) As the Providence of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſelf indifferently, as well in mercies, as in moſt kinde of judgements, to ſome of both ſorts of men, good, and bad; and again, in ſome perticular judgments, to all of both ſorts within a diſtance, and in both, moveth regularly according to the compaſſe of the Scriptures, ſo alſo doth it expreſſe it ſelf with a great deal of variation and difference, to the one ſort of men, and to the other, indifferently conſidered (I mean taken in the main body and bulk of both) in it's ordinary diſpenſation; and this too with a perfect agreement unto the Scriptures. Theſe (we know almoſt in every place, eſpecially in the Goſpel ſpeak of the troubles, and ſorrows, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which abide the Saints in this preſent world; as on the contrary, they give information, that the world ſhall gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have the better of it, and rejoyce when they ſhall mourne, <hi>Verely, verely</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Joh 16. 21.</note> and in them to all his Saints, in all their ſucceeding generations) <hi>I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoice;</hi> meaning, that this ſhould be, not the conſtant and uninterrupted, but farre the more frequent and ordinary eſtate and condition of either. Rejoycing amongſt the Saints, by reaſon of their outward condition in the world ſhould be but ſeldome, and for a ſhort ſeaſon: their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> ſhould be rare, and of a ſmall continuance, and in both reſpects, inconſiderable; in compariſon of the ſtanding proſperity, and the lifting up of the heads of their adverſaries (all moſt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:111412:183"/> without hanging down at any time) in the world. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (we know) hath many more paſſages and ſayings of like import. <hi>Yea and all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that will live Godly in</hi>

Whileſt it was the ſimple profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that expoſed men to perſecutions, and ſufferings from the world (as the caſe was till the daies of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) there were but few hypocrites in the Church, for (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerves) hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie did not encreaſe among Chriſtians, the till Name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity began to be honoured, and highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in the world <note n="a" place="margin">Poſt quan in tant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But however, whilſt it was the bare and naked profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that drew perſecution after it, all that join'd together in the profeſſion of it, whether hypocrites, or ſound, held together, expreſſed love and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affections, one to another: the common hatred and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution wherein they were joint ſufferers from the world, was of a ſodering and cementing nature unto them, kept them in love and peace. But when upon <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being a Chriſtian, there was no more perſecuting for the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; for ſome ſhort ſeaſon, they that were Chriſtians indeed, and who had the power, as well as the form or profeſſion of Chriſtianity, were free from perſecution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſame priviledge in this kinde, with thoſe that were formall and hypocriticall. And this great turn in the world is (I conceive) ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Rev. 12 7, 8, 9.</note> the great battel that was fought <hi>in Heaven,</hi> between <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and his Angels, and the <hi>dragon</hi> and his, it is ſaid, that the <hi>dragon</hi> and <hi>his prevailed not, nor were there place found any more in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, i.</hi> (I conceive) the devil could never after prevail
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:111412:184"/> with the world, at leaſt not with the <hi>Roman</hi> world (this Empire being elſewhere in this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the name of a world) to perſecute the name, or the bare profeſſion of Chriſtianity. So then after a while that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was ſetled in the Empire, the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity being now matter of honour and eſteem in the world, multitudes of perſons changed profeſſions, and would needs become Chriſtians; as we have amongſt us multitudes of drunkards, and ſwearers, and adulterers, and covetous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours, that will needs be Chriſtians, profeſſours of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as well as the beſt; the ſtate wherein they live, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a profeſſion of Chriſtianity. But it was not long, before theſe profeſſours of Chriſtianity, being multiplied to vaſt numbers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to taſte the different ſpirits one of another, in their different walkings and applications in the world. Thoſe who were carnall, and worldly, and complied with men in place and power, to be countenanced and preferred in the world by them, were cenſured and reproved by the holy and heavenly converſation of thoſe, who neglected the great things of the world, and applied themſelves cloſe to the principles of their profeſſion, and the great things of eternity, ſo long, till they were no longer able to bear it; but the wickedneſſe and hypocriſie of their hearts brake out and diſcovered themſelves, by ſtirring up the powers of the world (I mean, the civil Magiſtrate, into whoſe affections they had wound themſelves by undue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy applications) to perſecute the other, as being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous, in, and to, their ſtate. This (I conceive) is cleerly ſignified, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. of the ſame chapter, where its ſaid, that <hi>the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make warre with the remnant of her ſeed. The Dragon (i.</hi> as all Expoſitours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the <hi>devil;</hi> yea the holy Ghoſt himſelf ſo interprets) was wrath with the woman <hi>i.</hi> with the Church of Chriſt, indefinitely conſidered as a body or party of men profeſſing the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the world. The devil <hi>was wroth with this woman:</hi> why? becauſe ſhe had now gained into her party, his greateſt vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent he had, for the time being, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour: who till now had been the Son of his right hand, and made havock of Chriſtian profeſſion. But being ſorely galled and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:111412:184"/> vexed at this, by way of revenge, he <hi>went</hi> (ſaith the viſion) <hi>to make war with the remnant of the womans ſeed. He went</hi> viz. cunningly or by ſtealth, and as if it had not been he, (for ſo the word elſewhere ſignifies, <hi>Mat. 13. 25.) to make war with the remnant of the womans ſeed. i.</hi> with that remainder of Chriſtian <hi>Profeſſours,</hi> who were ſincere, and ſtood cloſe to the rule and principles of their profeſſion. But whether or to whom did he go, <hi>to make this war, with this remnant,</hi> or ſmaller part <hi>of the womans ſeed?</hi> Doubtleſſe to the other part, who were the farre greater part hereof; I mean, to ſuch profeſſours of Chriſtianity, who being now come where the <hi>hony</hi> of this world lay thick <hi>upon the ground,</hi> gave over the cloſe chaſe and purſuit of the world to come, and beginning at firſt only to lick and taſt, of this hony; in time they came to love it ſo inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, that they fed foul upon it, yea and ſurfetted. Now the Devil wiſely apprehending that there is no ſort of men, likely to make better ſouldiers for his purpoſe, when he intends to levy war againſt thoſe that are Saints indeed, then formall and worldly profeſſours of Chriſtianity, who commonly pretend to Saint-ſhip with more impatiency of being queſtioned upon the point, then they; unto theſe, being now grown numerous, and many of them potent in the <hi>Romane</hi> State, he applieth himſelf, and by working upon ſuch corrupt principles in them, (as pride, covetouſneſſe, ambition, and eſpecially that root of bitterneſſe, that hatred, wherewith they ſecretly burned againſt their Brethren, who in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and faithfullneſſe of walking, were ſeparated from them) which made them obnoxious unto him, in a ſhort time he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed them into ſuch a malignity of ſpirit againſt that holy <hi>remnant</hi> (we ſpake of) of <hi>the womans ſeed;</hi> that they conſulted hard things againſt them, and ſought their ruine. But of this carnall, worldly and perſecuting party, ſhortly ſprang that great and famous enemy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Saints, the great perſecutour of the righteous generation (ſirnamed Antichriſt) and he being advanced and gotten up into his throne became like an whore, who <hi>made all nations drunk with the wine of the wrath</hi> (or rather of the poyſon or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is true, this <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Beaſt, with his great aſſiſtants, the Kings of the earth, in the heat of their bloudy expedition, their courſe of perſecuting the Saints, meet now and then with ſome ſtorms and tempeſts of bloud from heaven falling upon themſelves; the ſeven vialls have been, and are to be all poured out upon their quarters. But as they that came to apprehend Chriſt, though they met with a ſore bruſh in attempting their enterprize, they were beaten backward down to the earth by the word of Chriſt; yet would not give over ſo, but got up again, and went on with their work; So though that <hi>ſcarlet whore,</hi> with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, who love to <hi>make themſelves drunk with the Saints,</hi> have been once and again ſorely rebuked from heaven, and have had their own bloud given them to drink: yet have not the wages made them out of love with their work, their ſtocks and ſtones which they worſhip and ſerve, have made them ſo <hi>like unto them</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh) that they cannot ſee truth in any religion, but only in that, which will be their ruine.

            <p>The Second kinde of ſubject, or veyne of matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Scriptures holdeth forth the operating Providence of God, conſiſts of things morall; or of a morall conſideration. And herein alſo, we may clearly ſee the ſame things acted and done in the world, which are preſented unto us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We ſhall mention only two particulars, and this very briefly, becauſe there is not much in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We know that the providence of God ſo ordereth and diſpoſeth between perſons and perſons, that ſome are of ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tempers and diſpoſitions, and of far better principles in matters of morality, then others. Some are by nature ſo Cynicall and froward, and <hi>Nabal</hi> like, <hi>that a man cannot speak to them;</hi> others, have that faireneſſe and delightſomneſſe of<note place="margin">2.

            <p n="2">2. The faithfull ſervants and children of God, many times ſpeed better, and are more courteouſly intreated, more juſtly dealt with, by meere naturall and morall men, and ſuch as are ſtrangers unto God, then by many that are forward and zealous profeſſours of religion. The daies wherein we live, have furniſhed us with many experiments, and obſervations in this kinde.

            <p>The Third and laſt generall head, of things mentioned, wherein the working or diſpoſing Providence of God, in the affairs and occurrences of the world, anſwereth the pattern of the Scriptures, is of things that are ſpirituall, or of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſideration. This correſpondency or agreement we ſhall take notice of in five particulars.</p>
            <p>1. In the variety or ſeverall kinds of means, by which men and wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ordinarily are brought home unto God, and built up in the knowledge of God. 2. in the property or quality of theſe means. 3. in the manner or terms, upon which men are brought home unto God, and ſavingly converted unto the faith. 4. in the different conditions, diſpoſitions, practiſes, of thoſe, who are brought home unto God, before this bleſſed motion is found in them. 5. (and laſtly) in the different growths or ſtatures, as well in knowledge, as in grace, of thoſe that are brought home unto God, after their coming into this eſtate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the ſeverall kinds or variety of means, by which men are ordinarily brought home unto God, the Scripture runs much upon three; firſt, judgements or afflictions: ſecondly, the excellent carriages and deportments of the Saints in their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: thirdly, (and laſtly) the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the Scripture ſpeaks much of afflictions, as of a kinde of ordinance ſanctified by God, for the reducement of men unto themſelves, and conſequently unto himſelf. Even as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>rod</hi> (in the letter, or properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) as if it were appointed by God to drive out that childiſh<note place="margin">Pro 22. 15.</note> folly or unto wardneſſe which is <hi>bound up in the heart of a child: but the rod of correction ſhall drive it far from him;</hi> In like manner, there is a kinde of folly, appropriate unto men; (you may call it ſpirituall folly,) a remiſſneſſe and negligence of ſoule, to look after the great things of their peace: which the Scripture repreſents as frequently cured, or driven out of men, by the hand of afflictions. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job, And if they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 36. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded, he openeth alſo their ear unto diſcipline, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi>—So the rod of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:111412:187"/> miſery and ſhame, drove away that abundance of folly which was bound in the <hi>Prodigalls</hi> heart before, far from him,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. Iſa. 26. 9.</note> and brought him home <hi>to his fathers houſe.</hi> And that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is of the ſame importance, <hi>When thy judgements are in the Earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſſe (with many the like.</hi>) If we looke into the world amongſt the Saints, and the congregations of the righteous, there are many of them will tell you, how they were driven in to their ſpirituall refuge or ſhelter, by ſome temporall ſtorm; not that tribulations or afflictions, have by, or of, themſelves, brought any man home unto God, but they have awakened many to enquire after, to attend, and intermeddle with that wiſedome, by which they have been brought unto God. As though a lye<note place="margin">Rom. 3 7.</note> in the nature of it, be moſt contrary to Gods glory, yet he can overrule it, and <hi>through his truth</hi> make it <hi>to abound to his glory;</hi> ſo though ſickneſſe and weakneſſe, and poverty, and diſgrace, and impriſonment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be contrary to the peace and comforts of men; yet God who ſometimes cauſed the ſun to turn head upon its own proper motion, and <hi>to goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> can, and many times doth, alter the courſe and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of afflictions, which is to make men miſerable, and to curſe them; but he makes them <hi>to bleſſe them altogether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures ſpeaks much of the worthy and excellent deportment of the Saints, as having great authority and power to work, and that ſaving-wiſe, upon the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of naturall men: and to perſwade and prevail with<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12. 3. 1, 1.</note> them, to the imbracing of that truth, which will both ſanctifie and ſave them. <hi>Let your light</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>ſo ſhine before men</hi> i. (let your converſation in all parts of it, be ſo pregnantly and convincingly excellent and holy) <hi>that they may ſea your good works, and glorifie your father that is in heaven. i.</hi> that beholding and conſidering the worth and heavenly import of your actions and courſe, they may be ſo taken and overcome therewith, as to turn Proſelytes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo have a rich and happy occaſion miniſtred unto them, of magnifiing God for ſuch a mercy. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> atrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes no leſſe to the royall walkings of Chriſtians. <hi>And have your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>they which ſpeak
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:111412:187"/> evill of you as evill doers, may by your good works which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the day of viſitation;</hi> cleerly implying, that the lives and waies of the Saints may be raiſed to that height and pitch of excellency and of glory, that the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ignorance, and unbeliefe of men will be aſtonied at them; yea and thoſe, who ſometimes were the firſt-born ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of theſe very men, be ſo far transformed in their mindes and ſpirits, as to bleſſe and glorifie God on their behalf, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſavingly touch'd their hearts and conſciences with the finger of their holy and heavenly converſations. So again cap. 3. 1. (of the ſame epiſtle) he ſuppoſeth that ſuch huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, <hi>who obey not</hi> (and ſo, either cannot, or will not be won by) <hi>the word, may yet, without the word, be won by the converſation of the wives, whilſt they behold their chaſt, or pure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> converſation, coupled with fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe if inquiry were made throughout the houſhold of faith in the ſeverall ſocieties of the Saints, up and down the world, there will many be found, who will confeſſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the godly, righteous, and ſober converſation of the Saints, have been benefactours to them in their ſpirituall affairs, and contributed richly towards their believing. Though I confeſſe that it is not like that this kinde of means, ſhould have bleſſed the world in theſe our daies, at any ſuch rate, as it did in the primitive times, or as it well might doe at any time; becauſe there is not, there hath not been, ſo much of God in the lives and waies of the Saints amongſt us, as was in the daies of the Apoſtles; Profeſſours of religion, in theſe daies, are creſt-fallen (as it were,) and ſunk many degrees lower and nearer to the Earth in their ſpirits, principles, actions, and deportments, in compariſon of what they were heretofore: there is too much of themſelves, and too little of God in their waies, to do any great things in the world in that kinde we ſpeak of. The <hi>Genius</hi> of Chriſtians and true beleevers in <hi>Pauls</hi> daies, was like that of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>viz. to forget the things that were behind, and to preſſe hard, [or endeavour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves] unto that which was before;</hi> whereas now ſuch a ſpirit<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> of unworthineſſe generally rules among profeſſours of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which perſwades them to remember <hi>the things that are
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:111412:188"/> behinde,</hi> viz. that they have truly beleeved, that they are in an eſtate of grace and ſalvation, that ſo they may have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not to endeavour themſelves <hi>towards that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> i. (as the Apoſtle had expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) towards <hi>the attaining of the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> meaning (the which elſewhere he calls) perfection. For when Chriſtians are excellent, and full of God, in their lives and ways, they live as it were in the ſtate of <hi>the reſurrection of the dead;</hi> wherein men are no wayes ſway'd or acted by the cares, or luſts, or ſears of this preſent world, or by any unworthy diſpoſitions, or diſtempers of their natures; but live (as our Saviour ſaith) <hi>like the Angells of God.</hi> If beleevers would <hi>ſow more liberally unto the ſpirit,</hi> would put more coſt, more of that precious ingredient, <hi>the reſurrection of the dead, into their lives,</hi> the ſtrength of their influence upon the world, (I mean upon the ſoules and conſciences of men yet naturall) would be doubled and trebled; and many more, in an ordinary way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would be wrought upon, and won to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by them, then now are. But this by the way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly, for this) The moſt common and effectuall means of all the reſt, which the Scriptures preſent unto us, as anointed and ſealed by God for the gathering in of <hi>Christs ſheep, into his fold,</hi> from their goings aſtray in the world, I mean, for the effectuall converſion of ſoules unto God, is the miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>the spreading abroad of the ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16. Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>of the knowledge of Jeſus Christ</hi> amongſt men. We know the Scripture ſpeaks much to this point: we ſhall not need to multiply places. <hi>Peter</hi> by caſting the <hi>net</hi> we ſpeak<note place="margin">Acts 2 41.</note> of, (the Goſpel,) out of the right ſide of the ſhip, <hi>incloſed a multitude</hi> of men fiſhes (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had told him that he would make him a <hi>fiſher of men</hi>) even three thouſand ſouls at once. So <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Take heed to thy ſelf, and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for by doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</hi> So that the miniſtry and preaching of the Goſpel, is the great ſtanding ordinance of heaven for the tranſlating of men and women from death to life; for the conveying and carrying them over that great lake or gulf, which lieth between an eſtate of ſin and unbeliefe on
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:111412:188"/> the one hand, and a condition of peace and bleſſedneſſe, on the other; Therefore they who deſpiſe, or neglect it, are as great enemies to themſelves and their own ſalvation, as thoſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and Lawyers were, who rejected the counſell of God againſt themſelves, in refuſing to be baptized by <hi>John,</hi> Luk. 7. 30. It were eaſie to make the pile of teſtimonies, greater in this kinde: but a firſt fruits inſuch a caſe as this, is better then an harveſt.</p>
            <p>Now we all generally know, and cannot but confeſſe, that ſuch as the Scriptures are in this behalf, ſuch are the actings and workings and diſpenſations of the providence of God in the world. Go through the Churches of the Saints, ask of the ſons and daughters of God in all their quarters, how and by what means, they came to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> which is in them: doubtleſſe they will generally anſwer you as with one mouth, that it was by that <hi>immortall ſeed of the word of God,</hi> ſown in their hearts, by ſome that went out from him to ſow it. There is not one amongſt many, but will give this account of their tranſlation <hi>from death unto life, from the power of Sathan,</hi> unto the kingdome of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures hold forth the active and working providence of God (in reference to things of a ſpirituall importance) as conſiderable in the property, or quality of the means, by which ordinarily men are ſavingly wrought upon, and brought home unto God. And that quality or property in the means we ſpeak of, which the Scripture principally eyes, as rendering all the ſeverall kindes of theſe means, that were mentioned, the more effectuall and proper for their ends (the bringing in of ſouls unto God) is an abundance of God in them; and as little of the creature as may be. Afflictions, the more they have of God in them; and ſo the lives of the Saints, the more they have of God in them; and eſpecially the miniſtery of the Goſpel, the more it hath of God in it; all theſe means (I ſay) of bringing men home unto God, the more they have of God in them, are ſo much the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and likely to proſper in their way. Firſt, thoſe afflictions have moſt of God in them, firſt, which are more extraordinary and rare, and that either in reſpect of the nature and kinde of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:111412:189"/> them, or of the degree of them, or of the ſecond means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them: ſecondly which have the moſt manifeſt ſympathy and agreement, or ſutableneſſe with ſuch ſins, one or more, in our lives, for which we have been moſt reproved; either by our own conſciences, or otherwiſe, and notwithſtanding have not forſaken them. Thirdly, which ſtrike us (as it were) in the maſter-veyn of our pleaſures and contentments in the world, when the firſt-born of all our enjoyments and contentments on earth, are as it were ſingled out from all the reſt, and ſlain, or elſe ſorely ſmitten, by the hand of God, in the affliction. Fourthly (and laſtly) which touch and ſmite the conſcience, without any outward breach made upon men. Such afflictions which have the greateſt proportion, of one or more, or all of theſe properties in them, are the moſt like of all others to be operative upon men in a way of ſalvation. If you firſt ſearch the Scriptures, and the world, you will finde the one anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other in the truth of theſe things. Thoſe troubles or afflictions which the Scriptures mention and record, as having wrought occaſionally upon men towards their converſion unto God, you will cleerly finde to have had one or more, of thoſe ingredients in them which have been deſcribed, and that in ſome conſiderable degree. We need not ſtand to examine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances. That ſmiting to the earth, which prepared the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to hearken the more attentively to the voice that ſpake to him from heaven, had much of God in it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſtrangeneſſe and extraordinarineſſe of it, as alſo of the means producing it, ſo the fear and aſtoniſhment in the <hi>Jaylor</hi> which had a ſaving tendency in it, by cauſing him to hearken to <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching of the Goſpel, had much of God in it too, in regard of the means producing it, which was the flying <hi>open of all the priſon doors,</hi> and the <hi>looſing of the priſoners bands,</hi> by means of a great earthquake, (or at leaſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with this <hi>earthquake,</hi>) I forbear any more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>I make no queſtion but ſome of you that are preſent, can parallell the Scriptures in this point, at leaſt ſo far, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that amongſt thoſe afflictions, which have befallen you, in the courſe of your mortall pilgrimage, thoſe which have had
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:111412:189"/> moſt of God in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome or other of the conſiderations men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have been moſt operative and effectuall upon you, to perſwade you to ſeek after God. So again,</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture preſenteth ſuch wayes and practiſes of the Saints, which have moſt of God in them, as of the moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious tendency to prevail with others (at leaſt ſuch as are capable of them) to enquire after God, to engage the world to look after the things of eternity. Now ſuch ways and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men have (in the generall) moſt of God in them, which moſt excell the common and ordinary waies and practiſes of men in goodneſſe, or which have the richeſt ſtrain of ſome ſuch excellency, which is very rarely, if at all, to be found in any degree, in the waies or practiſes of the men of this world. And that ſuch waies as theſe are of the richeſt tendency, to take the hearts and conſciences of naturall and worldly men, and to awaken them to look after the things of their peace, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intimated in the Scriptures. <hi>But I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>love your enemies, bleſſe them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despightfully uſe you, and perſecute you; that ye may be (i.</hi> appear, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your ſelves to be) <hi>the children of your Father which is in Heaven; for he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evill and on the good: and ſendeth rain on the just and the unjuſt: for if you love them which love you, what reward have you? (i.</hi> what ſpirituall ſervice do you unto men, for which God ſhould reward you?) <hi>Doe not even the Publicanes the ſame? And if you ſalute your Brethren only, what doe you more then others, do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi> The whole carriage of the place is clearly of this importance, that an uniform and conſtant tenour of ſuch actions and deportments, which in lovelineſſe and honour tranſcends the line of the common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and courteſies of the world, hath an excellent and potent tendency to bleſſe the world, by occaſioning or cauſing men to conceive honourable and worthy thoughts concerning God, his people and waies: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="354" facs="tcp:111412:190"/>
            <p>And if we had the opportunity to converſe freely with the hearts and conſciences of men, we ſhould meet with many exemplifications of the Scriptures in this particular. For (doubtleſſe) there are few, if any, ſavingly converted, and brought home unto God, whoſe converſion hath not received, either riſe or progreſſe, or both, from the vertuous and holy converſations, of thoſe who <hi>were in Christ before</hi> them: not is there any of theſe, if they pleaſe to recollect themſelves a little about the point, but w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) For the miniſtery of the word and Goſpel, the Scripture is yet more cleer in this: <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which hath moſt of God in it, is moſt effectuall, and for the moſt part, moſt fruitfull, either in bringing in ſouls unto God, or in building up ſouls in God. Now that miniſtery hath moſt of God in it, which hath moſt of Chriſt in it, with the leaſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wiſedom and weakneſſe of the fleſh: <hi>i.</hi> which 1. maketh the cleereſt and richeſt diſcoveries of God in Chriſt, <hi>i.</hi> of the minde and counſel of God concerning the ſalvation of men by Chriſt: and 2. which gives the cleereſt teſtimonies, that there is a reality and truth in thoſe things, which it thus diſcovers, without entermingling any thing, which is apt, or likely, to diſable this teſtimony in the hearts and conſciences of men. I adde this laſt clauſe, <hi>without intermixing any thing, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe, though men doe make rich diſcoveries of Chriſt, yea and doe argue and prove with ſome good authority and power, the reality and truth of what they diſcover in this kinde; yet if they mingle any thing of the fleſh herewith, if they attempt to bow, ſway or carry any paſſages of the Goſpel, to make them to comply with any worldly end, as to gain, or hold the ſavour of men, to gratifie the fleſh in any the luſts or<note place="margin">

For we are not, as many, which corrupt the word of God; but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Christ:</hi> cleerly implying, that look in what degree any man <hi>corrupts the word of God,</hi> in the miniſtery of it (<hi>i.</hi> embaſeth it with any mixture whatſoever for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the fleſh) the leſſe ſincere, or mindfull he is of the inſpection of God over him, whileſt he preacheth, he renders the Goſpel ſo much the leſſe powerfull and affectionate in his diſpenſation of it, either for the conviction, or converſion of men: he cauſeth it to give forth ſo much the weaker and fainter ſmell, or <hi>ſavour,</hi> either of death and condemnation to the wicked nd impenitent, or of life and peace, to the righteous and beleever. When the Goſpel is preached <hi>ſincerely,</hi> and as it comes <hi>from God,</hi> it caſts forth a ſtrong ſent, and fills the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills of the ſouls and conſciences of thoſe that believe and ſubmit unto it, with a moſt odoriferous and pleaſant ſavour of life, peace, and joy, in the love and favour of God: as on the other hand it ſends forth a ſtrong ſent or ſmell of the fire and brimſtone of hell, and of the eternall vengeance of a moſt dreadfull God, into the noſtrills of all that are ungodly and diſobedient. And in what degree the ſpirit of it ſhall be at any time ſtifled, clogged or allayed, by any carnall ingredient, it loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth proportionably of the ſtrength and vigour of either of theſe operations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the manner, or terms, upon which men and women are ſaviugly brought home to God, the Scriptures repreſent the caſe under this difference: <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome <hi>paſſe from death to life,</hi> after ſome ſuch manner, as <hi>Peter</hi> informs us that <hi>the Heavens ſhall paſſe away in the great day of the Lord, <gap reason="foreign">

God ſhakes the foundations of the hearts of ſome, and makes all that is within them to quake and tremble, when he is about to remove them: others he removes with ſo gentle and ſoft an hand, that it cannot be perceived, that ſo much as the leaſt hair of their head is ſhaken in the tranſlation.</p>

Concerning the different diipoſitions and practices of perſons, before their reconciliation unto God; the Scripture preſenteth ſome, vile and abhominable above meaſure, in both: Others without any notorious blot or foulneſſe in either: ſome very conſcientious in wayes and practices, of a grievous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We mentioned a ſixth particular, under this head (which <label type="milestone">

We ſhall not inſiſt upon any explication, or traverſe of this argument, becauſe the confirmation of the truth of it depends alltogether upon hiſtory, and may be had in abundance, by peruſing the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall records of all ages, partly before, but eſpecially ſince, the days of the coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, into the world.

And as ſometimes it comes to paſſe, that he that heaves at a ſtone that is too heavy for him, and ſeeks to take it up, and bear it away upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is thrown back and daſht to peeces, by the weight of it; So have many, both perſons, and kingdomes, heavd at the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thoſe that held them forth, attempting the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall both of the one, and of the other, out of the world: whoſe enterprize hath recoild upon them, with ſuch violence, that their bones have been broken, yea they and their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes daſhed in peeces by it.</p>

Thus hath it been done, and thus ſhall it be done ſtill, to that doctrine, to that religion, with the true profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of it, <hi>which God will honour:</hi> but it neither hath been, nor ſhall be ſo done unto any other. And thus we have done with our ſixth and laſt of the firſt ſort of arguments, to evince the divinity of the Scriptures, under the ſecond generall head, which we called, extrinſecall. Theſe arguments were ſuch paſſages or acts of Providence, whereby God plainly owns the Scriptures as his, and as proceeding from him.</p>
            <p>The latter kinde of arguments contained under the ſame generall head, conſiſts of ſuch, partly doings, partly ſayings of men, which are ſo far confederate with thoſe providences of God, as to joyn in teſtimony with them in the behalf of the Scriptures. We ſhall be very briefe both in the propoſall, and arguing of theſe, though they be both the one and the other of them, of as large a conſideration, as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There have been, and are daily acted and done by men ſuch things, which cleerly prove the Scriptures to be from God. Theſe again may be divided into two ſorts: they are either 1. ſuch actions, by which the predictions or propheticall carriages of the Scriptures (I mean, ſome of them, and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>inently conſiderable) are fulfilled, or elſe, 2. ſuch by which the doctrinall, or ſententious paſſages of the Scriptures, and theſe like wiſe very remarkable, are verified and aſſerted.</p>
            <pb n="368" facs="tcp:111412:197"/>
            <p>For the former. The actions of men, by which that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prophecy, which ſpeaks in them, is juſtified, <hi>i.</hi> by which the things predeclared and foretold by this ſpirit, are accordingly performed and done in the world, doe give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the Scriptures, that they are divinely inſpired, and from God. Thus the act of <hi>Judas</hi> in betraying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles flying, thoſe actions of the ſouldiers in crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thoſe mortiall actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they conquered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> defaced and demoliſhed the temple, not <hi>leaving one ſtone upon another,</hi> all theſe did abundantly demonſtrate the Scriptures to be from God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtian worlds, wondring after the Beaſt,</hi> ſo long together, the <hi>ten Kings, in giving their Kingdomes unto the Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in making war with the Saints, with many other actions of men, prophetically fore ſhewed in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> do the like. At this day (amongſt our ſelves) they that expreſſe hatred againſt the Saints (godly men) for <hi>Christs ſake, i.</hi> for that of <hi>Christ</hi> which is in them, their godlineſſe or holineſſe; ſo again, they who act as men, that cannot, or will not, endure ſound doctrine (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch doctrines or truths, though never ſo agreable to the word of God, which croſſe their carnall ends or humours, or temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns but <hi>after their own luſts will heap up unto themſelves teachers) i.</hi> will ſeek out and follow, they care not how many teachers, that will comport with them, and ſtrengthen their hand, in their ſinfull and unworthy waies; they (I ſay) who do ſuch things as theſe, do by ſuch actions, confirm and ſeal the divine originall of the Scriptures, though they intend nothing leſſe. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes ſaid of <hi>the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and their rulers, that becauſe they knew not Chriſt, nor yet the words of the Prophets, which are read every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day amongſt them, they fulfilled them in condemning them:</hi> So may it be ſaid of many the inhabitants of London, and of<note place="margin">Act. 13. 27.</note> their rulers, that becauſe they know not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor the words <hi>of the prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though they be read yes and preached <hi>unto them every Sabbath day,</hi> yea and oftner too, they fulfill both in condemning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in many of his ſervants, and in many of his Truths; and conſequently by

This briefly for this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Great ſinners under the Goſpel, rightly interpreted, are notable aſſertours of the Divinity of it.</p>
            <p>The latter proof or demonſtration of the Divinity of the Scriptures, of the two laſt mentioned, was the conſideration of ſuch paſſages of ſpeech, or ſayings of men, whether in their writings, or otherwiſe, which reflect the light of that divine authority upon them, which hath been aſſerted hitherto. This argument, ſhould we traverſe it in the full extent and compaſſe of it, would, I conceive, be more prolix, and take up more time, in the explication and proſecution of it, then any, yea I ſuppoſe then all the former have done. But I have promiſed you a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:111412:199"/> concluſion of the whole, in this ſermon; and therefore for this promiſe ſake, ſhall preſent you only with a firſt-fruits, inſtead of the harveſt, confining my ſelf to a few particulars, amongſt many. Nor ſhall I inſiſt upon, or ſo much as mention, any of thoſe ſayings or paſſages of ſpeech, which fall ever and anon from the lips of men in theſe daies; no nor yet upon any thing found in books or writings either of a modern date, or whoſe authours are ſuſpected as ſuppoſititious and counterfeit, though out of theſe three quivers, there might many arrows be drawn, to ſlay the unbeliefe of men, concerning the divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of the Scriptures: but I ſhall only produce ſome ſpeciall teſtimonies out of ſome ancient writers, of the beſt credit and authority within their line and ſphere, yea of far better with with many then the Scriptures themſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then (in the generall) this is conſiderable, that though the penmen of the Holy Ghoſt, do <hi>not receive the testimony of men,</hi> (as our Saviour himſelf ſpeaks in a like caſe) <hi>i.</hi> doe not need, or ſtand upon <hi>the teſtimony of men,</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching or confirmation of the truth of their writings, but are confident that what they write will gain authority and credence in the judgements and conſciences of men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other terms, though the teſtimony of men, ſhould fail them; yet God deſiring that men, who do believe them, ſhould beleeve abundantly, <hi>that ſo the heirs of promiſe might have</hi> every waies <hi>ſtrong conſolations,</hi>

            <p>This in generall: For particulars, by which the truth of the generall will fully appear, there are ſo many of them taken notice of, and drawn together in the books and writings of Chriſtian authours, who have laboured in this argument, both heretofore, and of later times, that the time would fail us (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in a like caſe) yea and ſtrength too, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them all particularly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning the creation of the world by God; this
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:111412:199"/> is one of the greateſt, and moſt wonderfull things aſſerted in the Scriptures, the ſerious and effectuall beliefe whereof muſt needs make ſuch a breach upon the judgement, reaſon, and underſtanding of a man; that this being once entred and gotten in, other things reported in the Scriptures, will hardly keep out. All the miraculous and wonderfull things of the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, are but as ſparks of that flame of infinite power, which ſhone to the cleer manifeſtation of it ſelf, in the creation of the univerſe. And yet this great and moſt conſiderable piece of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (the creation of the world by God) how great a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hath it from amongſt the heathens for the confirmation of the truth of it? He that ſhall peruſe, what <hi>Mercurius Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus</hi> (one of the moſt ancient writers amongſt the heathen) hath left in thoſe fragments of his works, which are preſerved, and to be found in other ancient authors, concerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we ſpeak of (the creation of the world by God) will be half perſwaded, that he had ſeen <hi>Moſes</hi> text, and meant to write a kinde of comment upon it: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>darkneſſe upon the waters;</hi> this <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> repreſents in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, <hi>a dreadfull ſhadow hovering on the moist nature,</hi> as it were <hi>brooded by the word of God; Moſes</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God ſpake,</hi> and that forthwith things were made: <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth and bringeth in <hi>Gods word ſhining, whereby he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the light, and made the world, and all that is therein.</hi> And ſo he goeth on, as it were hand in hand with <hi>Moſes,</hi> a great way together, paraphraſing upon his expreſſions. I might here add the teſtimony alſo of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> one of the ancienteſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who (as himſelf reporteth) had been in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he ſaid he had learned, that there was but one God, <hi>and that the Air, the Heaven, the Sea, the Earth, and Hell with all things in them, had dwelt or harboured in the breſt of this God from eternity</hi> (with many other high and excellent expreſſions of himſelf in this point) It were endleſſe to cite the teſtimonies of all thoſe authours, famous for wiſdome and learning to this day, who plainly taught and avouched the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, and all things by God; as of <hi>Empedocles, Heſiod, Parmenides, Sophocles, Aeſchilus, Euripides, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, Thales, Anaxagoras, Plato,</hi> with many others.</p>

            <p>Concerning the building of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the confuſion of tongues, ſome of the foreſaid authours write thus. <hi>The common opinion is</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that men being bred of the earth, and truſting in their own ſtrength, would needs in ſpite of the Gods, goe rear a tower up to the Sun, in the ſame place where</hi> Babylon <hi>now is: and that when they had raiſed it very high, the Gods overthrew it, and caſt it down upon their heads with a great winde; and that at this time began the diverſity of languages: whereupon the Hebrews called the place,</hi> Babel.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie (as before was intimated) to make this pile farre greater, and to fetch in credit and authority in abundance from forreign authours, ſuch as they afford, to ſtrengthen and inrich all other the relations of Scripture, with reputation of truth; and particularly thoſe which ſeem moſt obnoxious.

               <hi>In the time of</hi> Tiberius <hi>there was one Jeſus, a wiſe man (at least if he was to be called a man)n who was a worker of great miracles, and a teacher of ſuch who love the truth, and had many, as weſt Jews as Gentiles who clave unto him. This was</hi> Chriſt. <hi>And when Pilate, upon his being accuſed, by the chiefe men of our nation, had ſentenced him to be crucified, yet did not they who had firſt loved him, forſake him. For he appeared unto them the third day alive again; according to what the Prophets, divinely inſpired, had foretold concerning him, as they had done an innumerable number of very strange things beſides. And even to this day, both the name and kinde of perſons, called Chriſtians, ſo named from him, remain.</hi> This <hi>Josephus</hi> was a Jew, as well in religion, as by nation: though he wrote in Greek.

            <p>For a concluſion: As the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>truly Jeſus did many other miracles in the preſence of his diſciples, which were not written in his book: but whoſe he did write, were written, that men might beleeve that Jeſus is the Christ the Sonne of God, and that beleeving they might have life through his Name</hi>
